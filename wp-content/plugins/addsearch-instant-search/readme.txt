Instant search for your WordPress site. Search as you type, synonyms, typo fix, content promotions, analytics and other advanced search features.

== Description ==

AddSearch Site Search plugin replaces the standard Wordpress search with a lightning-fast search that gives you accurate results instantly. And when we say instant, we mean that literally: you get results even with the first character, giving your search a polished, high-end feel and responsive performance.

= FEATURES =

* **No coding required**. Installing the plugin takes minutes: just copy one line of text, and you're done.

* **Design customization**. With a few simple CSS tweaks, you can adjust the look and feel of the search to match your website style.

* **Misspellings**. ddSearch understands what your visitors search even if they make a typo.

* **Ranking control**. Decide which pages and areas are more important than others.

* **Search statistics**. You get full statistics on search behavior incl. most popular searches and searches with no results or clicks. You can also integrate your search analytics with **Google Analytics**.

* **Automatic content updates**. AddSearch recrawls your site automatically and adds new content to the search.

* **PDFs, DOCs, and PPTs**. Your search can provide PDFs, MS Word, and PowerPoint documents in the results.

* **Mobile-friendly**. AddSearch's UI adapts to any device, including desktops, tablets, and phones. You don't need to do anything for full mobile support, even if your site isn't responsive or mobile.

* **Language support**. AddSearch works with any language.
