"6","en","article","1","2","10 Easy Ways to Troubleshoot Common AC Problems","1560189840","1620930955","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;There are few things more frustrating than your air conditioning unit not working at the peak of summer heat. Without a functioning AC unit, your home becomes uncomfortable and your energy bills can spike. If your unit isn’t keeping you cool, try these 10 troubleshooting tips to get it back up and running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/air-conditioner-repair#blog&quot;&gt;before calling for air conditioner repair&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Set Your Thermostat Correctly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step you should take when troubleshooting your air conditioning unit is ensuring that your thermostat setting is on cool rather than heat. Yes, this may sound like a no-brainer, but people forget to change this setting after the winter months more often than you would think. Complete this quick step first before moving on to other troubleshooting tasks or calling a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Close Your Windows and Doors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tip may also seem obvious, but leaving windows and outside doors open is a common way that people misuse their air conditioning unit. When you allow warm air to enter your home through windows and doors, it causes your AC to work overtime to cool the air. This means you spend more on your cooling bills than you need to and it makes your unit less efficient over time. So, make sure your family remembers to always close windows and exterior doors when the AC is running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Investigate for Tripped Circuit Breakers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that your air conditioning won’t turn on because your circuit breakers were tripped due to overloading. Check the AC breakers on your electrical panel and turn them off and on again. Then try running your AC a few minutes later to see if it will work. If not, you may need to replace the fuse. If the breakers and fuse still aren’t working, &lt;a href=&quot;/electrical/electrical-repair?utm_source=enercare-blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=electrical_repair&quot;&gt;call a licensed electrician&lt;/a&gt; to take a look to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Clean Your Air Filters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dirty air filter is one of the most common causes of air conditioning problems. Dirt, dust and pet hair build up over time, clogging the air and slowing down your AC. Air filters are located in your furnace and should be replaced every three months, particularly if you have pets or run your unit frequently. Ignoring your air filters can lead to much higher energy bills and broken equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Call a Technician to Check for Low Refrigerant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your air conditioning unit is not cooling your home properly, it could be because you don’t have enough refrigerant. Refrigerant is what pulls heat and humidity out of the air and it is the key element to run an efficient AC unit. You may need to add more refrigerant, however, it’s also possible that low refrigerant is due to leaks in your system. In that case, you may need to &lt;a href=&quot;/electrical/electrical-repair?utm_source=enercare-blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=electrical_repair&quot;&gt;replace your AC unit&lt;/a&gt; if the leaks are too severe for repair. In either case, a technician with the proper equipment is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Open Your Air Vents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have purposefully closed vents in rooms that you don’t use very often, thinking that this would save money on your energy bills. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plumblineservices.com/help-guides/should-my-ac-vent-be-open-or-closed&quot;&gt;closing vents in your home can cause damage to your air conditioning unit&lt;/a&gt; and lead to expensive repairs or replacements. All homes lose some amount of air through tiny duct leaks. Closing vents pushes more air through and puts extra pressure on ducts, causing even more air to be lost through leaks. So, if you think keeping vents closed saves you money, be aware that it may actually make your energy bills go up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Get Your Air Ducts Cleaned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to leaks or tears in your air ducts, they may also be clogged with dirt and dust. In some more extreme cases, your air ducts may also have mould in them. Sometimes, you can tell if your ducts are blocked if you see dust coming out of your vents or your air conditioning unit is cooling the air unevenly. If you notice a musty smell when you turn on your AC unit, that could indicate mold. In either case, if you suspect your air ducts are dirty, you should get them inspected and cleaned by a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Investigate for Water Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If water is leaking from your air conditioning unit into your home, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.searshomeservices.com/blog/air-conditioner-not-working-problems-and-solutions&quot;&gt;turn it off immediately to avoid costly water damage&lt;/a&gt;. These leaks are sometimes caused by a drain line becoming clogged and backing water up into your home. You can try troubleshooting the drain issue with a wet/dry vacuum to see if that will stop the water leak. If not, it is likely a different part that needs to be replaced by a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;9. Check Your Outdoor AC Unit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a problem happens with your AC unit, it’s often because the system components within your home aren’t working properly, such as the vents and ducts. But don’t forget to take a look at the outdoor part of your unit (also known as the condenser). Over time, debris, such as weeds, dirt and leaves, can build up on the condenser, causing inefficient cooling and higher energy bills. Try spraying the unit with a hose to clean off the dirt and debris, cut any grass or weeds around the unit, and make sure any large objects are at least two feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;10. Call a Licensed Technician&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have outlined many steps you can take to troubleshoot your AC problems, but sometimes these DIY tips aren’t quite enough. Always make an effort to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/ac-maintenance#blog&quot;&gt;keep your unit well-maintained&lt;/a&gt; to prevent costly repairs or replacement and identify when it’s time to call a professional. In certain cases, a licensed technician is the best solution to safely solve your AC problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend you get your air conditioner inspected near the end of spring. A professional inspection provides peace of mind (and wallet), letting you know if your system is in good working order before you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it comes to maintaining&amp;nbsp;your equipment, an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/ac-maintenance&quot;&gt;air conditioner maintenance plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;can help prevent breakdowns by solving future problems before they occur, such as faulty materials or carbon monoxide leaks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ur certified technicians can assess your current equipment and generate a personalized report of recommendations to ensure your unit runs safely and efficiently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Enercare, we understand how frustrating it can be when your air conditioning unit isn’t working correctly, especially at the height of the summer heat. We are here for you to help diagnose any AC problems you are having.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Is Your Household One of Them?","1555697309","1593722120","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Family on couch&quot; data-align=&quot;right&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;712d73f3-c204-4656-b111-fc6a22f4a876&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/stocksytxp5899f8881bw000original636893_0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Enercare we’re always curious to learn more about the families and the homes that we serve, especially when it comes to air quality and water safety in the home. In 2017, we partnered with Ipsos to survey 800 Ontario homeowners and discovered that nearly half of Ontario households were unaware of the impact air quality and water purification has on their family’s health. Results also revealed that almost half of Ontarians aren’t doing enough to purify their air and tap water. Do you know which half your household falls under?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What We Learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never before has health and wellness been as valued as it is today, with so many technologies and tools available for consumers to monitor their health. However, our survey showed that many people in Ontario are not thinking about the long-term impact that the quality of their air and water supply has on their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out of the 800 Ontario homeowners surveyed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41%&lt;/strong&gt; had never &amp;nbsp;cleaned their air ducts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28% &lt;/strong&gt;did not know where the air ducts in their home were located&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;73%&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;had never tested the quality of their home’s tap water&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;48%&lt;/strong&gt; did not do anything to purify their tap water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can relate to the homeowners represented in those results, don’t worry. There are steps you can take to feel empowered about your home’s health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering how the health of your home can impact your family, making a few simple changes can significantly enhance the quality of your home’s air and water quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replace your air filters every 90 days, or as often as every 45-60 days if you have allergies and/or pets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-carbon-monoxide-sensor&quot;&gt;carbon monoxide sensors&lt;/a&gt; to alert you to this odorless, poisonous gas&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have your &lt;a href=&quot;/duct-cleaning&quot;&gt;air ducts cleaned&lt;/a&gt; to remove mold, fungus, pet hair, and construction debris&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Purchase an in-home air quality monitor to keep an eye on your home’s air quality between professional cleanings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Invest in a water filtration system, such as a reverse osmosis system, which removes contaminants from the water supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Enercare Can Help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Enercare, we never stop thinking about the health of your home, and we remain committed to the goal of creating awareness around the importance of home health and its impact on you and your family. In 2017, we opened the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/kare&quot;&gt;Kare Air and Water Boutique&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto to inform the public of the potentially unpurified air and water in their homes, as well as educating homeowners on chemicals and contaminants that could be hiding in their air and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also committed to providing professional, high-quality services that test and treat your air and water quality beyond what you can do on your own. This is particularly true for water quality since in-home tests are not highly accurate and do not test for all contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The quality of air and water in your home is part of the foundation of your health. We know this can be daunting, and we’re here to help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like poor air quality in your home may be making you sick or worsening allergies? Are you concerned with the quality of your tap water? &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;Get in touch with Enercare&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about the ways we can help create a healthy home environment.&lt;/p&gt;

"16","en","article","1","2","9 Sensors Every Smart Home Needs","1553191770","1593722393","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Today’s homeowners know how important it is to protect their investments, whether from intrusion, fire, earthquake or flood. But you can’t always be at home and every second matters when things go wrong. &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home&quot;&gt;Smart home devices&lt;/a&gt; and sensors can make the difference for time-sensitive emergencies by saving you time, protecting your possessions and preventing anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The marketplace is saturated with dozens of smart home sensors, which provide a wealth of real-time information to homeowners by sensing weather conditions, temperature, movement, moisture levels, and more. We’re here to help you sift through the noise with a list of nine smart sensors every smart homeowner needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Temperature Sensors &amp;amp; Smart Thermostats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-home-temperature-sensor&quot;&gt;Smart home temperature sensors&lt;/a&gt; constantly measure the temperature within your home and make adjustment recommendations to your smart thermostat. Smart thermostats can turn themselves down in the winter when you’re away and re-adjust just before you get home. Some smart thermostats can also adjust individual room temperatures based on the current activity in that room. These smart features may help to save energy and ensure constant comfort levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Light Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light sensing smart devices can turn off the light switch when you don’t remember to and smart bulbs let you set lighting schedules. So, even if you forget to turn the basement light off, a light sensor will do it for you. If you’re on vacation, you can set smart bulb timers to go off and on to give the impression someone is home. Or, you can control them manually with your smartphone. You can also set times to adjust their brightness — dimmer during the day and brighter at night. These settings may help you save hundreds of dollars over the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Motion Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a motion sensor detects movement, it sends a signal to your phone or other devices like cameras, lights or alarms. You can combine motion sensors with other devices to solve a variety of problems. For safety, use a motion detector to send you a notice if there’s movement by your swimming pool. This can help protect small children playing in the area. Or you can connect a motion sensor to a &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-home-security-cameras&quot;&gt;smart security video camera&lt;/a&gt; at your door to notify you when there is movement. This is a great way to be aware of package deliveries and help catch intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Water Leak/Freeze Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-home-water-leak-sensor&quot;&gt;Water leak sensors&lt;/a&gt; can save you money on monthly bills and repairs from water damage. Fixing easily corrected household water leaks can save homeowners &lt;a href=&quot;https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/www3/watersense/pubs/fixleak.html&quot;&gt;about 10 percent on their water bills&lt;/a&gt;. Smart homeowners use leak detectors around vulnerable areas of their home where water leaks are a risk. For example, place them near your hot water tank, under your sink, or around exposed water pipes. After a water sensor alerts you to leaking pipes and appliances, you can rush home to take care of the problem or phone a plumber before more costly damage occurs. An alternative is to install an automatic shut off valve, that gets notified of leaks from the leak sensors and can turn off your home’s water supply when a leak is detected. This can also save you time and costly damage in case you’re not close by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Window and Door Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alerts for open windows and doors are another indispensable sensor that can save you money and keep you safe. Smart garage door openers will warn you if someone’s forgotten to shut the garage door. Smart window locks will sound an alarm and notify you if an intruder opens or breaks a window. Door sensors can also save energy when you connect them to smart lighting, which can turn the lights on and off when someone enters or exits a room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Video Doorbell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-video-doorbell&quot;&gt;Smart video doorbells&lt;/a&gt; trigger when motion is detected at your front door. They’re equipped with video cameras that take wide-angle HD images. Even if you’re not home, you can view a live video stream of an intruder, package delivery or visitor. Some doorbells can even learn individual faces and announce the visitor’s name when they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Weather Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weather sensors are like temperature sensors but for exterior conditions. Use them with your smart lawn sprinklers to base your watering schedule on the chances of rain. If the temperature suddenly drops or a thunderstorm hits, a weather sensor connected to your window sensors could tell you which windows are open and need to be closed to protect from rain damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Smart Smoke and CO Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to smoke and carbon monoxide, smart smoke sensors can also monitor the air quality in your home for pollen, dust or other particulates. Some smart smoke detector models can even differentiate between burnt toast and an actual house fire, giving you a chance to cancel the alarm before it goes off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of smart home sensors is moving to develop better ways to integrate all of your devices. Major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple are developing their assistants as control hubs for many of these smart devices. As these technologies progress, it’s expected that homeowners will use them to manage and optimize their energy consumption. Home safety will continue to be a priority, as mobile devices become the central hub into the status of our homes while we're away at work or on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing frequent water leaks from your water heater, then it may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/new-boiler&quot;&gt;time for a new boiler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"126","en","article","1","16","8 Ways Your Smart Home Can Save Energy","1553196327","1593729525","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Energy costs are cutting more and more into household budgets, and families are beginning to look to smart home energy solutions to shrink their monthly utility bills. &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home&quot;&gt;Smart home devices&lt;/a&gt; like thermostats and appliances are highly efficient because they can automatically adjust to changing energy needs. Plus, they can detect inefficiencies so electricity, water and gas waste can be minimized. Your energy consumption can be reduced exponentially when smart devices run your home. Here are eight ways of running a smart home that can save you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Smart Water Leak and Freeze Detectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When water leaks and pipes freeze, the result can often flood a home causing costly cleanup and expensive repairs. Smart water leak and freeze detectors can help you stop leaks before they damage precious heirlooms, electronics and personal treasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-home-water-leak-sensor&quot;&gt;smart water leak detectors&lt;/a&gt; under your sinks, around your hot water tanks or any other water source. These detectors can text or email you about a water problem so you are aware even if you’re not at home. Early detection can help avoid wasting gallons of water or having to replace a ruined carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Smart Thermostats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nest Labs released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://downloads.nest.com/press/documents/energy-savings-white-paper.pdf&quot;&gt;smart thermostat study&lt;/a&gt; that found the average household could save 10–12 percent on heating costs and 15 percent on cooling by using a smart thermostat. A home’s heating and cooling system gobbles up the biggest chunk of energy use in the home, so those percentages can translate into savings each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart thermostats and &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-home-temperature-sensor&quot;&gt;temperature sensors&lt;/a&gt; can adjust to energy needs on the fly. There is less need for heating and cooling when no one is at home. You can program smart thermostats and control them remotely with your smartphone. Set your thermostat to keep your furnace off when you’re away but warm the house just before you arrive. These smart settings can help you save on your heating bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Smart Light Bulbs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart bulbs are light bulbs that talk to your Wifi network and you control them with an app. Much like a smart thermostat, you can program smart bulbs to turn on and off to save energy. Some smart bulb brands detect when you’re headed home and turn the lights on automatically. If you accidentally leave your lights on, you can turn them off remotely. You can also adjust the brightness of a smart bulb, saving you electricity by dimming them when a bright light isn’t required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Smart Plugs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a smart home platform yet, you can start small by using smart plugs. These smart devices plug into your electrical outlets and are used to manage the energy consumption of whatever you plug into them. Their apps let you program times of use, remotely turn on and off power and even view your total energy consumption. If your teenager’s television or computer is consuming too much energy at night, program it to turn off at a specific hour, or just power it off from the comfort of your bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Smart Appliances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart appliances like washing machines, refrigerators and coffee makers are changing the way we interact with our kitchen gadgets — they talk to us. If you leave your refrigerator door open, you get a notice on your phone. If your smart washing machine needs repair, it can email you about the problem. Getting repairs done quickly can prevent you from incurring the cost of completely replacing your appliances. For folks who pay different electrical rates for peak times, your dryer can even let you know when you’ll be charged the least amount for drying your clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Smart Home Security Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart home security systems will communicate with your phone when there’s an intruder, and even lets you view a live stream of your property. These features keep you safe, but they can also cut costs. False alarms are a common problem with home security systems, and they can get to be costly if the local police department begins issuing you fines for repeated calls. Smart security lets you see if the problem is a real 911 emergency or simply an aggressive squirrel using your security camera to take a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Smart Sprinkler Systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving on your water bill is another smart device advantage. Smart sprinkler systems use automatic irrigation systems that knows the weather forecast. These sprinklers automatically set your lawn watering time to match future rain chances. No more watering the lawn during a downpour because you forgot to turn off the sprinklers. Smart sprinklers also run water usage reports so you’ll know when you’re using too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Smart Garage Door Opener&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even garage door openers have gotten clever. Today’s &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-garage-door-opener&quot;&gt;smart garage door openers&lt;/a&gt; integrate with smartphone apps and can tell you when the door is currently open or closed and lets you close and open the door remotely. These smart models are generally more cost-efficient to operate and some are equipped with battery backups in case of power failure. Being warned that your garage door is open helps prevent intrusions and keeps your house from losing its heating and cooling efficiency due to a wide-open garage door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of ways to get smart home energy savings with web-connected devices like these. But investing in smart devices for your home also helps the planet. Canadian households are one of the world’s biggest energy consumers &lt;a href=&quot;http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/average-household-electricity-consumption&quot;&gt;compared to other countries&lt;/a&gt;. So, even a tiny drop in per-household energy consumption could result in huge benefits nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are experiencing frequent water leaks from your water heater, then it may be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/new-boiler&quot;&gt;time for a new boiler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
With our summers being hot and sticky, it is important to ensure your air conditioner is running as efficiently and effectively as possible. Here’s what you can do to beat the heat and to ensure your equipment runs at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Get your air conditioner inspected at the beginning of the season.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing in the pros for an AC inspection at least once a year will give you the confidence that it’s in good working order before you need to turn it on. Remember, failing to maintain your equipment can shorten its lifespan and possibly lead to premature failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Clean or replace furnace filters.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean or replace furnace filters every three months, even in the warmer weather. Clogged filters mean that your furnace motor will potentially work harder and use more energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Clear area around the condenser unit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With most air conditioning systems, the condenser unit is located outside the home and is prone to accumulate debris in the area surrounding it. Remove debris and cut any grass or weeds around the unit that could be obstructing airflow from the condenser fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Consider these additional cooling tips:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure you remove the winter cover from the air conditioning unit before you turn it on for the first time. Leaving the cover on could lead to much bigger problems. The outdoor unit needs to release warm air. If unable to, it can overheat and potentially breakdown.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reverse the direction of ceiling fans so that they spin counterclockwise blowing straight air down. This will help redistribute the warm air trapped near the ceiling making the room feel cooler.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Close blinds and drapes on all south and west-facing windows when leaving the house during the day. This really helps to keep the home cool, minimize the amount of time your air conditioner actually comes on when you are not home and, can help reduce your energy bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/air-conditioner-repair#blog&quot;&gt;Advanced AC repairs&lt;/a&gt; and maintenance can be dangerous and are best left to professionals.

"136","en","article","1","16","Make your home energy efficient in just 10 easy steps","1491268499","1593729274","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to boost the energy efficiency of your home, including replacing the furnace or dishwasher, cleaning air ducts, changing filters, installing a thermostat or switching to LED lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you think your home is energy-efficient, there are probably still a few areas where you could make some improvements and save some money on your energy bill. If you are looking at making some home improvements that will make an impact on your energy usage, we suggest considering one or more of the following measures to help take your energy conservation to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airtight Windows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good insulation around your windows and doors will prevent loss of heat, consequently lowering the amount of energy needed to maintain the temperature at a comfortable level during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Furnace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can afford to install a new, more advanced furnace in place of your old one, you may be able to recoup the investment over time by saving on your energy bill every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Programmable Thermostat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing a programmable thermostat device may lower your energy bills in any season of the year. A device that automatically controls the temperature without the need for human intervention is a smart way to optimize the use of your HVAC system. This is the best way to keep your home at the ideal temperature when you’re not at home and ensure it’s comfortable for when you return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Clean Filters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replacing the filters in your heating system will facilitate smoother airflow&amp;nbsp;through the house, especially when coupled with duct cleaning, leading to more efficient fuel consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Switch to LED&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is well known that LED lighting uses far less electricity to produce the same luminosity, which means that replacing the bulbs in your house with LED technology can make a huge difference in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Replace Dishwasher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your dishwasher is among the largest energy wasters in your home, especially if it’s been in use for a while. Purchasing a more energy friendly model should be among your priorities if you have the financial means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fridge Ventilation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrigerators need some free space on the back side to operate at optimal efficiency. Also, try to avoid overloading the interiors if you want your fridge to use less electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On-demand Water Heater&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of maintaining a reservoir of hot water at all times like classic heaters, these practical devices are turned on only when you actually need hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Duct Cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling an air duct cleaning service at least once every five&amp;nbsp;years is a good practice that will help remove dust from the HVAC system and enable it to operate at maximum capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Efficiency Audit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get the full picture of all the money you could be saving, it is best to ask for a professional assessment of your home and its energy efficiency features.&lt;/p&gt;

"141","en","article","1","16","How to Troubleshoot a Furnace: 10 Common Problems and Solutions","1516760633","1623979069","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Your furnace is one of the most complex appliances in your home. So when it stops working there is no time to lose. Here is a troubleshooting checklist that’ll help you narrow down the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Is your thermostat set to “Heat”?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To troubleshoot a furnace, start with the obvious. Is your thermostat set to &quot;heat&quot;? If yes, check that your temperature setting is high enough to activate the furnace. Remember: your furnace has to heat up first before the blower comes on. So, be patient. Keep your thermostat user guide stored near the thermostat. That way, you can consult its troubleshooting section when a start-up problem happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Are your thermostat batteries low?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your thermostat is battery operated, the cells may be dead. Many programmable thermostats feature a flashing &quot;low battery&quot; icon on their control screen. If you see a &quot;low battery&quot; warning, put in fresh batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Is your furnace switch working?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your thermostat is working, see if your furnace power switch is off. Look for the switch mounted on the side of the furnace. It may also be a simple light switch on the wall. Some furnaces have a switch with a fuse. Check to see if it’s blackened and burnt. If so, replace it and turn the switch back on (or hire a professional to help).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Do you have a tripped breaker?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the switch is on, but your furnace is still not working, check to see if you have a tripped breaker. Your breaker box is (hopefully) labeled “Furnace” or “HVAC” next to the correct breaker. If not, look for a tripped breaker and reset it, if you can.&lt;br /&gt;
If your furnace now has power, congratulations. But also beware — a tripped breaker and/or burnt fuse may indicate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/electrical/electrical-repair#blog&quot;&gt;bigger problem with your electrical system&amp;nbsp;that needs repair&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;It’s best to be safe and have a licensed electrician or HVAC expert inspect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Is your front panel door secure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern furnaces come with safety switches on their front panels that don’t allow the furnace to engage if it’s not properly closed. Check to see if your panel door is secure. Read your owner’s manual if you’re unsure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Is your pilot light on?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a gas furnace, the pilot light must be on for it to work. Pilot ignition is a safety feature that ensures gas doesn’t flow through the burners until there’s a flame ready to ignite them. Lighting a pilot light can be dangerous. It’s best to get professional help from a licensed technician before modifying anything in your furnace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. Are your filters clogged?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dirty and clogged furnace filters are a common problem. Air filters trap dust, hair, and other particles. If not changed regularly, they can restrict air flowing through your furnace system. Heat and pressure can build up to dangerous levels. Newer models have detectors that keep the furnace from operating if the filters are clogged.&lt;br /&gt;
Clogged filters also restrict airflow. Your furnace can be heating air, but not be able to transfer it. If so, it can’t heat your home. Change the filters and see if that solves the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;8. Are your vents and registers closed or blocked?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your furnace is running but the house is still cold, your outflow vents and registers may be closed or blocked. This is especially common for heating ducts in the floor. Check to see if your vents are open and that no rugs or furniture are obstructing them. Vents are often located near external walls under windows. And even long curtains can obstruct airflow or re-direct it to undesired directions. If your vents are blocked, &lt;a href=&quot;/duct-cleaning&quot;&gt;schedule a duct cleaning service&lt;/a&gt; to get everything flowing smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;9. Is something blocking your fresh air intake?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all furnaces vent through chimneys. Many newer furnaces have their fresh air intakes and exhaust runs through the side of the home and deep snow, windblown leaves, insects, and moisture can create exhaust problems. If this is the case, consult a licensed technician about possible venting solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;10. Have you called an expert?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to keep your furnace running is to have your heating system inspected by an expert before winter strikes. Annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-maintenance&quot;&gt;furnace maintenance&lt;/a&gt; by a licensed technician can save you time, frustration, and money.&lt;br /&gt;
If you’ve tried everything and your furnace still isn’t working, call Enercare to speak with an Enercare licensed technician. They can do a deeper dive into specific issues with your furnace model — before you need an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;emergency furnace repair &lt;/a&gt;call for no heat in winter&lt;/p&gt;

"146","en","article","1","16","What to Do When Your Gas Appliance is Red-Tagged?","1555723751","1615585900","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;If one of your gas appliances, like a furnace or water heater, was recently given a red tag by a gas technician, you likely have many urgent questions about what this means and how to take care of it. We’ve put together some common red tag questions to provide you with the answers you need to get back on track with your home heating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is a red tag?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A red tag, also known as a product warning tag, may be placed on a gas appliance by a licensed technician to indicate that the appliance is no longer safe to operate and either needs to be repaired or replaced. Depending on the severity of the issue, the technician is required by law to turn off the gas as a safety measure to protect you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What are the types of red tags?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Type A: If a licensed technician has identified an immediate danger, for example, a severe carbon monoxide leak, your furnace gets a Type A red tag and your natural gas will be immediately turned off.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Type B: If the furnace does not pose an immediate danger to the homeowner, a Type B warning tag will be applied to the furnace and the local utility notified (e.g., Union Gas or Enbridge). This tag gives you a 30-day deadline to have the equipment repaired or replaced. If corrective action is not taken by the deadline, your natural gas will be turned off by the local utility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why have I received a red tag?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have likely received a red tag because a licensed gas technician has identified a hazardous issue on your appliance or piping system that uses natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a defective heat exchanger is identified, it can release carbon monoxide into your home. Carbon monoxide is an odourless and colourless gas, which can cause serious health problems or death if undetected. It is harmful because it can rapidly accumulate in the blood, reducing the blood's ability to carry oxygen to vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If carbon monoxide is leaking from a cracked heat exchanger, there is a chance of it mixing with the air that is generated by the furnace and pushing through the vents in your home. To prevent this danger, a Type A red tag is applied to your furnace, your local utility is notified, and your natural gas is turned off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can I repair my furnace or do I need to buy a new one?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you need to repair or replace your furnace depends on how serious the issue is. For example, if you received a Type A red tag for a crack in the heat exchanger, you will likely need to replace your furnace because the cracks are very difficult to repair. If you received a Type B red tag, then the issue is less hazardous, and it’s more likely that you will be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;repair your furnace&lt;/a&gt; within the 30-day timeframe. However, if your furnace is close to the typical 20-year lifespan, it may be best to replace it and &lt;a href=&quot;/heating/furnace-maintenance&quot;&gt;practice proper furnace maintenance&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can’t afford to purchase a new furnace, you might consider &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-advantage/furnace-rental&quot;&gt;furnace rental&lt;/a&gt; as an option.&amp;nbsp;The same advice applies to water heaters too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/enercare-advantage/water-heater-rental&quot;&gt;Water heater rental is an option&lt;/a&gt; when you can't afford to buy a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What should I do if I receive a red tag?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately call a licensed contractor like Enercare to inspect your equipment. Dealing with natural gas requires extreme care. Our experienced, licensed technicians approach all jobs with safety as a priority. Receiving a red tag on your appliance can be confusing, frustrating, and scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Enercare we are here to help you figure out what steps you need to take to keep your family safe and comfortable.&amp;nbsp;If your furnace has been condemned, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;get in touch with us&lt;/a&gt; to talk with a heating specialist about your &lt;a href=&quot;/heating/furnace-repair&quot;&gt;repair&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-advantage/furnace-rental&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An annual inspection on your furnace can help identify potential problems before they become costly breakdowns and ensure your equipment is operating safely and efficiently. &amp;nbsp;There are checks you can do yourself and those that need to be performed by a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Do-It-Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Examine the heating system occasionally for signs of deterioration, such as water stains, corrosion or leakage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In forced-air systems, clean the furnace air filters&amp;nbsp;frequently – at least twice a heating season.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep the area around the furnace free from dust, lint, rags, paint, drain cleaners and other materials or chemicals that could catch fire or explode if they become too hot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure warm-air outlets and cold-air outlets are not covered by carpets or blocked by debris.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure walls, other obstructions or new renovations do not block the heating system’s air supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Call a Professional&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common problems can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Duct work loosened due to normal thermal expansion and contraction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blower motor bearings in need of lubrication.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replacing of air filter and cleaning of dust from blower fan blades and AC condensing coil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An inspection can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;find and repair&lt;/a&gt; less obvious problems like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Loose blower belt.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improperly firing burners.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Blocked condensate drain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Loose wiring harnesses.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a temperature sensor helps create a more balanced temperature throughout your home.&amp;nbsp; The sensor does this by communicating the temperature of the room where it is located and the thermostat does an average of the rooms and adjusts accordingly.&amp;nbsp; Or, you can set your HVAC equipment to use the temperature sensor as it&amp;#39;s temperature guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensor needs to be placed in an area with good airflow so it can get an accurate temperature reading.&amp;nbsp; It shouldn&amp;#39;t be placed near a&amp;nbsp;source of hot or cool air or covered in any way which would make the temperature reading incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding a notification for a critical temperature alert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Notification&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; on the right side.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click on blue &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;New Notification&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; button at the top right.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature Alert&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select the device you wish to be notified of.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose temperatures you would like to be notified about, add recipients and select devices.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuring your Enercare Smarter Home light switches:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;From the home screen select the card called “&lt;strong&gt;Lights&lt;/strong&gt;” by clicking on the right arrow.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This leads to the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Lights&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; pages which has three sub-tabs -&amp;nbsp;“&lt;strong&gt;Device&lt;/strong&gt;”, “&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;” and “&lt;strong&gt;Schedules&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ol&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Device Tab:&lt;/strong&gt; The device tab lists every Smarter Home smart light in the home. Each smart light will have its own tile where you are able to click on the specific light you want to turn on or off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules Tab:&lt;/strong&gt; The rules tab lists out all the rules that you have set up. Rules are triggered by a specific event in the home.&amp;nbsp;For example, you can turn on the kitchen light once the front door is unlocked, or turn on the porch lights if motion is sensed.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule Tab&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Schedules will automate when to turn on or off the lights according to your settings.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To set up a new rule:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Log into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;From the home screen select the card called “&lt;strong&gt;Lights&lt;/strong&gt;” by clicking on the right arrow at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select &quot;&lt;strong&gt;+ Add New Rule&lt;/strong&gt;” button at the top right of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Enter the name of the new rule.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select the “&lt;strong&gt;Lights&lt;/strong&gt;” radio button to automate the lights.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select when the event should occur, either “&lt;strong&gt;Sensor Activity&lt;/strong&gt;” or “&lt;strong&gt;Door Bell Camera&lt;/strong&gt;”. &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Sensor Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is triggered when a sensor becomes active, for example, if the front door opens, or if the living room detects motion. &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Door Bell Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is triggered if the user wants the lights to come when the&amp;nbsp;doorbell is either pressed or detects motion.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select if the light should turn on or off and the time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select which specific light the rule should be applied to by checking all check boxes that apply.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select when the rule should be active, either at all times, or users can outline specific times of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Press &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; to save the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To create a new schedule:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Log into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;From the home screen select the card called “Lights” by clicking on the right arrow at the top of the page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Schedules&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select &quot;&lt;strong&gt;+ Add New Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Enter the schedule’s name.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select which devices the schedule applies to. For example, front light or office light.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select which days of the week the schedule should run.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select if the lights should turn on or off and at which time of day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Press &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; to save the schedule.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water damage is responsible for 23% of homeowner’s property losses annually.&amp;nbsp; The longer a leak goes undetected the more damage it can do and the more costly it can become – upwards of $20,000 for a repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most homeowners insurance will cover the cost of the damage but it can’t replace sentimental items like photos or memorabilia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid water damage in your home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use an Enercare Smarter Home Water Leak Sensor that can be placed under a sink, by a toilet, behind your washing machine, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have an Enercare Smarter Home Water Valve Shut-off so you can turn off the main water line in your home if a leak exists so you can minimize the damage until the leak is fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have your plumbing pipes checked by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/plumbing/plumbing-repair#blog&quot;&gt;licensed plumber&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/blog/plumbing/simple-tips-winterize-your-homes-plumbing&quot;&gt;winterize your home’s plumbing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add an Enercare Smarter Home Temperature Sensor in an area in your home that gets cold and is near plumbing – like a crawl space.&amp;nbsp; If the temperature dips to a very low point, you can set up a notification that lets you know about the cold before your pipes freeze.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track your energy usage, turn off devices and adjust your home's temperature simply and easily through the Enercare Smarter Home Portal&amp;nbsp;or mobile app.&amp;nbsp; Take it one step further and see what devices, appliances or electronics in your home are consuming the most energy using Smarter Home plugs, switches and energy management clamps. Setup scenes so you can start saving by turning off items when they aren't needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enercare Smarter Home also includes an energy usage dashboard that allows you to calculate estimated savings using the current electricity&amp;nbsp;rate of your provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Saving tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermostat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As much as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=heat_cool.pr_hvac&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/a&gt; of your home’s energy use is from heating and&amp;nbsp;cooling, so programming your thermostat to help reduce energy use is important.&amp;nbsp; In the winter, set your thermostat to 15°C&amp;nbsp;when you aren't home and reduce your heating costs by up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torontohydro.com/sites/electricsystem/electricityconservation/residentialconservation/pages/seasonalconservationtips.aspx&quot;&gt;20%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Going on vacation? Set your thermostat lower in winter or higher in summer to help save energy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replace your furnace filter regularly - every one to three months, including in the summer if you have air conditioning.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Close your curtains and blinds in the summer to help keep the heat out and open them in the winter to let the heat from the sun in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Instead of leaving your lights on outside when you are coming home late and wasting energy, set up geo-fencing so your lights are on only when you need them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before bed, check that all your lights are turned off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these tips are common sense even if you don't have an Enercare Smarter Home, with the ability to automate&amp;nbsp;it becomes easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you just need to set up a geo-fence. A geo-fence is a virtual geographical boundary that is set up around your home&amp;nbsp;address to allow you to create rules and alerts based on the GPS location of one or more smartphones. You may enable this feature&amp;nbsp;at any time through the Enercare Smarter Home Portal or the mobile app. Here’s how to get started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to set up a geo-fence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From your account homepage, click &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; in the left side panel.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-Services&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Add a Fence&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete the following fields:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;
	&lt;table&gt;
		&lt;thead&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;th&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/th&gt;
				&lt;th&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/thead&gt;
		&lt;tbody&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Move fence location to:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Enter the address where the geo-fence is to be located and click the arrow button.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Alternatively, click and drag on the map marker to move the geo-fence to the desired location.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Use the +/- buttons on the map to zoom in/out.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;123&amp;nbsp;Avenue, Town, Ontario&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Fence Name:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Enter a name for the geo-fence.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Work&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
			&lt;tr&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Radius:&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/td&gt;
				&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Enter the desired radius for the geo-fence.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Alternatively, click and drag the anchors on the map to expand or decrease the desired radius.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The minimum radius is 3km and the maximum radius is 150km.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;3km&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &quot;Save&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;To set up a geo-fence rule or alert, click on the appropriate &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-Feature&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select the appropriate options you would like to enable for the rule/alert and click &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If required, repeat Steps 9-13 to set up additional geo-fences.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note if there is&amp;nbsp;more than one geo device&amp;nbsp;attached to this account, all devices must enter or exit the geo fence before the action will take place&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To setup using your mobile device:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home mobile&amp;nbsp;app on your smartphone.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; button in the top left corner and scroll down.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-Services&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Move the &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-Services&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; slider to the right to turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A pop-up will appear asking for you to confirm. Click &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Turn On&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; (Android) or &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Enable&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; (iPhone).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;For iPhone users, a message may appear asking for permission to access your location.&lt;/em&gt; Select &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Always Allow&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;For Android, a message will appear indicating that Geo-Services has been enabled successfully&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note if you have&amp;nbsp;location services turned off on your smartphone&amp;nbsp;for privacy reasons, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the geo-fencing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; function will not work on the Enercare Smarter Home app.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To help you get started in understanding your new doorbell, here are some answers to some frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What if someone knocks instead of ringing the doorbell?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doorbell has a motion sensor that you can activate in the mobile app.&amp;nbsp; If someone is at your door the motion sensor will activate and you will receive an alert so you can view the video feed.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. How do I record a video clip when someone rings my doorbell or when the motion captures movement in front of my door?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the Enercare Smarter Home Portal or mobile app, go to &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; on the left side of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Recording Schedules&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go to either &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Doorbell Call&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Doorbell Motion&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; and toggle it on or off.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click the pencil icon to edit the settings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure to &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Assign Recipient&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; if you want to be notified when a video clip was captured.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How long are these video clips and is there a limit to how many that can be captured and stored?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each video clip is about 30 to 45 seconds and it varies based on the duration of the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A new clip is recorded if the activity lasts more than 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Each month you&amp;nbsp;can upload up to 1,000 clips.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can store up to 1,000 clips online.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go to &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Saved Video Clips&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; tab to view your stored clips.&lt;br /&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. How do I adjust the sensitivity of my motion sensor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log&amp;nbsp;into the Enercare Smarter Home Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; on the left side of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Doorbell&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; from video device drop down at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Video Device Info&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Scroll to the bottom of this page.&amp;nbsp; It will allow you to adjust the sensitivity as well as the target size.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Will the doorbell let me know if someone is at my door when I&amp;rsquo;m not home?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can see who is at your door from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Can I turn the chime off my doorbell?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can use the silent mode any time you need it to be quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. If my WiFi stops working, will my doorbell stop working too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your doorbell &amp;lsquo;s chime will still work but it won&amp;rsquo;t be able to send alerts or take video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Will my doorbell stop working if my mobile phone&amp;rsquo;s battery has run out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, your doorbell will work normally.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s not dependent on your mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Does my doorbell need to be protected from the elements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doorbell is built to withstand harsh environments like hot and cold weather.&amp;nbsp; As well, the doorbell is sealed to help keep moisture out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Why is my doorbell turning red?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that your doorbell isn&amp;rsquo;t connected to your WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. What are the doorbell&amp;rsquo;s video specs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Field of view: 120-130 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;
	Resolution: 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. How is my privacy ensured?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cameras use password protection to prevent access from outside the Enercare Smarter Home Portal or mobile app and the Enercare Smarter Home cameras employ advanced MD5-based &amp;ldquo;digest authentication&amp;rdquo; for user authentication. More simply, it&amp;rsquo;s the same kind of technology that banks use to ensure your privacy and security.&lt;strong&gt; Please note:&amp;nbsp;No one from Enercare or its technology partners can view your live video stream or your saved videos.&amp;nbsp;Only you, as the account holder have access to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

However, space heaters can be dangerous if not handled appropriately. If you plan on using one to help make your bedroom or living room extra toasty in the winter, please keep the following space heater safety tips in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Only Use Electric Space Heaters Inside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should only use an electric heater inside your home. Ful-burning space heaters are intended for open-air use and should never be brought into the house, even if you are undergoing furnace maintenance and have no other source of heating. Using a fuel-burning space heater inside could expose your family to carbon monoxide or other poisonous gases. For the safety of you and your loved ones, it’s always best to stick with smaller, electric space heaters. If your furnace is not working properly and you’re relying on a space heater, Enercare is available to help with your &lt;a href=&quot;/heating/furnace-maintenance&quot;&gt;furnace maintenance needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Place Heaters Away from Furniture and Walls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your space heater on a hard surface that is level and non-flammable, such as concrete or ceramic flooring. You should try to leave appropriate space around the space heater (check the operating manual) since the device may be powerful enough to quickly set objects on fire if they are placed too close. Be especially careful with flammable items like drapes, furniture, and clothing that could easily catch on fire. Also, make sure not to place heaters in doorways or the middle of the room to prevent a tripping hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Keep Heaters Away from Water and Wet Items&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space heaters don’t mesh well with water, so you should always position them as far away from any source of moisture as possible. Space heaters should only be used in bathrooms if they are a model specifically built for use around water. Never use your space heater to dry clothes or bed sheets, as this can become a serious safety issue if the fabric catches on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Don't Leave Your Space Heater on Overnight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A space heater should be used only for a limited time and should never be left unattended. Space heaters can’t regulate temperature well for long periods, which can be dangerous when not actively monitored, and also lead to higher energy bills. Therefore, never leave your space heater on overnight or all day when you’re at work. Whenever you use a space heater to quickly warm up an area of your home, make sure to turn it off before leaving the room, especially if you have kids or pets that could touch the hot surface or trip over the cords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prevent Space Heater Fire Hazards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe placement of space heaters and keeping them attended is essential for preventing space heater fires. There are a couple of other steps you can take to ensure maximum safety:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure that your space heater is plugged directly into a wall outlet rather than with an extension cord. Adding cords increases the chance for a fire.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install and maintain smoke detectors in the home, to ensure an extra layer of protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Check for Safety Features and Certifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re shopping for a space heater, choose a model that includes these following safety and certification features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;automatic shut off in the event the heater tips over&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;overheat sensors that will shut off the heater if the temperature gets too hot&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a grill to prevent fingers from getting too close to the heating element&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;safety certification from an organization such as the Canadian Standards Association (CSA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric space heaters can be a simple, inexpensive way to warm your home, however they should not be relied upon as your primary source of heat. It’s important to maintain your furnace to ensure proper heating of your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the winter months,&amp;nbsp;homeowners&amp;nbsp;face a number of issues. From snow to cold temperatures, the home is affected in a variety of ways.&amp;nbsp;Plumbing systems in the home can be significantly affected by the colder temperatures. Plumbing pipes have a tendency to freeze in very cold weather, which can lead to a burst pipe in the home. This can be a big problem and cause major damage to the home as well as your plumbing system. Knowing how to react and what to do in the case of a plumbing disaster will help you to save time as well as money on repairs and damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Tell if Your Pipes are Frozen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be able to tell that you have frozen pipes&amp;nbsp;in a number of ways. For many homeowners, the plumbing runs through the walls of the home. If you begin to see wet spots or water leakage coming from baseboards then you have a problem. Water can leak from basically anywhere in the home that is near the busted pipe. Once you see that you have a leak in the home, turn the water off. It is likely that the pipe holding the water became frozen and burst open. The water will then thaw and begin to leak into the home wherever the break is. You will need to cut off the water to stop the flow so that no more water can affect the space. To do this, you will need to know where the water shut off valve is. The main water shut off valve is commonly located near the water meter. Turn the valve to shut the water off. The toilet supply also has a water shut off valve. This valve can be used when working on the toilet and can be found near the wall behind the tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you move into your home, it is important to locate where the water shut off valve is and how it works. You need to know this location so that you can turn the water off when you need to, especially in an emergency. The main valve in a home should be turned off and on every 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Contact Professional Assistance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have found that a plumbing pipe has burst, contact a plumbing professional, such as our team at Enercare, to assist you with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/plumbing/plumbing-repair#blog&quot;&gt;repairing the broken pipe&lt;/a&gt;. Our experts can handle this issue quickly and effectively to ensure that your home is not damaged further due to water leakage. The pipe will be repaired and ready to function properly, restoring water usage in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Prevent Frozen Pipes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways for homeowners to avoid frozen plumbing pipes in the home. To begin, pay attention to the colder weather. Water starts changing from a liquid to a solid at +4.11 C degrees (39.4 F degrees) so it does not have to be below freezing to cause damage. Consider the following preventative measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn your outside hose faucets off in the home at the isolation valves;&lt;br /&gt;
Open the hose faucets outside to let the remaining water leak out and leave them open for the winter;&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure all hoses are disconnected from the hose faucets, as the remaining water will freeze and expand back into the home and can cause your pipes to burst;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have irrigation systems (automatic sprinkler system), make sure the lines are blown out by an irrigation professional;&lt;br /&gt;
Frost-free hose faucets should also be winterized the same as regular hose faucets;&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure that piping in vulnerable spots such as garages and outside walls stay above freezing;&lt;br /&gt;
Keep garage doors shut or insulate the piping in those areas from cold breezes;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have a sump pump, it’s a good idea to check the working order because they work harder in the winter months with the snow runoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeowners are often looking for ways to save money and the environment, and one way to do this is by cutting down unnecessary energy use. By updating or changing the way you use your home appliances, you can increase your home’s efficiency, protect the environment, and save on your annual utility bills without compromising comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Home Energy Conservation Tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are several ways you can conserve energy so you can keep your cool when your next utility bill arrives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t Over Adjust Your Thermostat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can save on your annual energy bill by changing your thermostat habits. During hot summer days, avoid cranking your thermostat down thinking the house will cool faster. Air conditioners make your home feel cooler by removing humidity, which takes time. Lowering the thermostat drastically won’t make your home cool faster because the humidity hasn’t been removed. Doing this only makes the AC run longer to reach the lowered thermostat set point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want more control over your temperature settings, you should consider investing in a smart thermostat. A smart thermostat learns your heating and cooling preferences based on your behaviours. It communicates with temperature sensors in each room, adjusting your home’s heating and cooling to reach your ideal settings automatically. Plus, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/enercare-smarter-home&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;smart home technology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can decrease your energy consumption by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartneighbor.com/blogs/neighbor-notes/can-smart-home-devices-cut-energy-costs#:~:text=A%20smart%20thermostat%20can%20avoid,per%20month%20on%20utility%20bills.&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;about 10 to 20 percent per month&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Find the Right Temperature Set Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Generally speaking, the smaller the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures, the lower the heating and cooling costs will be. To find the best temperature for comfort and energy savings, conduct an experiment with your thermostat. While you’re at home set your thermostat to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hrai.ca/consumer-tip/primer-on-ac-maintenance&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;25.5 C, the recommended set point for summer months&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and adjust the set point by one or two degrees at a time. You want to find as high of a temperature in the summer, or as low of a temperature in the winter, as comfortably possible while managing humidity levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Set Back Your Thermostat When You’re Away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;During winter months, lowering the thermostat by up to two degrees while you’re away from home can help save on heating costs. While this is an effective strategy in the heating season, it’s not recommended for the summer. It’s much harder to cool rather than heat a space because you need to factor in humidity control. The energy required to remove accumulated humidity from setting back your thermostat and cool your home back to the desired set point is often more than the energy required to maintain a specific temperature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Utilize Your Ceiling Fan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another way to save on energy is to use your ceiling fan to help keep your home cool. As the summer approaches, run your fan counterclockwise to create cool air without air conditioning. When the weather gets hotter, use your ceiling fan as an extra boost to disperse the cool air from your HVAC system throughout your home without setting the air conditioner on full blast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Besides cooling, ceiling fans can also help you save on heating. During the cooler months, running your fan clockwise can help push the warm air that rises to the ceiling down into the rest of the home without creating a breeze.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether it be to cool or heat your home, running a ceiling fan can help you save on your monthly energy bills while keeping your home comfortable. Just be sure your fan is rotating in the right direction for your desired effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Monitor Shower Length and Update Your Showerhead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The best way to reduce the amount of water you use while showering is by being mindful of how long you run the shower. If your household struggles with this, try setting a timer for each shower. We also recommend installing low-flow showerheads. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brothersplumbing.com/plumbing/benefits-of-using-a-low-flow-shower-head/#:~:text=The%20current%20standard%20today%20is,less%20of%20water%20per%20minute.&amp;amp;text=If%20it's%20full%20in%2010,take%2024%20seconds%20or%20more.&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standard showerheads release 2.5 gallons of water each minute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, whereas low flow showerheads use 2 gallons of water or less. These small changes can add up to save you on water usage and cost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wash Clothes in Cold Water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your washing machine uses more hot water than your shower and dishwasher combined. One of the best ways to conserve energy is to use a wash cycle that washes and rinses your clothes in cold water. If your washer is not a high-efficiency model, then consider replacing it with an energy-efficient model. You can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-homes/what-energy-efficient-home/what-does-energuide-label-mean/20562&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;consult an appliance’s EnerGuide label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to learn more about its energy-efficient qualities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While you’re at it, hang your clothes up to dry to boost energy savings in the laundry room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manage Your Electronics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smartphones, laptops, game consoles, and chargers each use small amounts of electricity that can add up in electricity costs. Did you know that the average Canadian household has 25 or more electronic devices?&amp;nbsp; Many devices drain energy even when they’re not on - this is called phantom power and can account for up to 10 percent of a home’s energy use. Monitoring and unplugging your electronics after fully charging can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hydroone.com/saving-money-and-energy/residential/tips-and-tools/phantom-power&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;save you up to $150 a year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get Double Paned Windows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your windows make up about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.e-education.psu.edu/egee102/node/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;15 to 20 percent of your home’s surface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, so it is important to make sure air is not leaking through window cracks and gaps. Even the best sealed single-pane windows have low R-value insulating property. Double pane windows have gas in between the panes that work to increase insulation. Double pane windows can also raise your R-Value by blocking off air gaps in cold and warm weather. Upgrading your windows can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/advantages-of-double-pane-windows/&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;save you nearly 25 percent of your annual energy costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seal Your Chimney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a wood-burning fireplace, it is important to close your chimney damper until it is completely sealed off, especially in the summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Over time, heating and cooling can warp a chimney damper and affect how well it seals. If your damper is leaking, hire a professional to replace it or try an inflatable chimney balloon. When inflated, chimney balloons form a tight seal within your flue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure Attic Ventilation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can save on heating and cooling costs by ensuring adequate&amp;nbsp;ventilation throughout your home. During the summer months, proper ventilation moves hot air out of your attic, cooling your home. In the winter, proper ventilation keeps warm, moist air from forming condensation and lowering your insulation’s effectiveness. Check with a professional to see if you have enough attic ventilation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another way to stop cold and hot air from escaping your roof is by adding more layers of batting type insulation to your attic. There are many types of insulation. Be sure to get expert advice on choosing the best type of insulation for your application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plant Hedges and Shrubs to Insulate Your Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just like how trees shade your house during the summer, shrubs near your home help insulate your exterior walls from heat and cold. Hedges and shrubs work as windbreaks by forming an air envelope that helps insulate exterior walls and spigots. For best results, plant &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/aac-aafc/agrhist/A53-899-1983-eng.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hedges that grow well for your region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; around 30 cm from your exterior walls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Close and Cover Your Windows in the Summer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your home is too humid, your rooms feel sticky and uncomfortable. Since your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/new-air-conditioner#blog&quot;&gt;central air conditioning unit&lt;/a&gt; cools your home by removing moisture, it’s important to keep your windows closed during summer months when it’s more humid outside. By opening windows, you let in humidity, which will make your air conditioner run longer to reach a cool indoor temperature. The ideal humidity level for a home is between 35 and 50 percent. Also, avoid additional heat gain in the home by closing window coverings where there’s direct sunlight during the sunny summer months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add Motion Sensors to Exterior Lights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your porch light gets left on for long periods of time. Install motion sensor lighting with high-efficiency compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) or LEDs instead of incandescent ones to help cut back on energy that is often unused.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Upgrade Your Heating and Cooling System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Newer HVAC systems are more efficient and cost less to operate, saving you money and energy.

&lt;h3&gt;1. Keep it simple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set your family recycling cans in a high-traffic area, preferably near the garbage can.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prominently mark each can to help your kids separate recyclables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Set clear goals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Help your kids understand the impact recycling has on the environment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Provide a tangible goal like throwing out no more than three bags of trash each week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep track of each successful week.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Treat your family to pizza at the end of a good month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Work with them to conserve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Teach your kids to not be wasteful with materials they already use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have them draw on both sides of their paper or write on both sides in their notebook.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Encourage them to use the same cup throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Donate clothing or toys your children have outgrown to a local charity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Let them share in the profits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Split any profits from recycled bottles or cans among your family members.&lt;/li&gt;

"236","en","article","1","16","Benefits of Using a Humidifier at Home","1516852253","1580854128","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why your family needs humidity in your home. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/report-environment/indoor-air-quality&quot;&gt;people spending 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their time indoors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/air-quality.html&quot;&gt;maintaining indoor air quality&lt;/a&gt; is a modern necessity. Dry air can cause damage to your home and your health; however, you can prevent this damage with a humidifier. But what exactly is a humidifier? How does it work? And what are the benefits? Let’s take a look at how humidifiers work and what the benefits are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Types of Humidifiers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humidifiers are often broken down into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;portable or central – which determines the size or coverage of the humidifier; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;cool mist or warm mist – which describes the water temperature used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best humidifier for you depends on your preferences and what is right for your family. Regardless of which type you choose, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/in-depth/humidifiers/art-20048021&quot;&gt;only filtered water&lt;/a&gt; should be used to prevent mold or bacteria growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Portable Humidifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portable humidifiers are best suited for single-room use because they are too small to effectively humidify an entire home. These models can be handy because they are inexpensive and&amp;nbsp; can be moved&amp;nbsp; from room to room depending on your needs. However, you will need to fill and clean them frequently to maintain the water quality. Also, they contain smaller motors made for shorter periods of continuous use, and can therefore have a more limited lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Central humidifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central humidifiers are attached to your home’s furnace over a hole cut into the return air duct. A central model lets you humidify your entire home at once. It also allows you to monitor and control your home’s relative humidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done by using a small water line to bring water to moisten the pad. Water flow is regulated by a low-voltage electronic valve and a humidistat that measures and maintains the relative humidity according to your settings. A short air duct from the supply side (near the plenum) brings warmed air into the humidifier. The warmed air then flows through the pad and into the return duct, carrying the moisture throughout the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central humidifiers should have yearly maintenance to keep them running efficiently. Before heating season begins in autumn, schedule a &lt;a href=&quot;/heating/furnace-maintenance&quot;&gt;professional furnace maintenance visit &lt;/a&gt;with Enercare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cool mist humidifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool mist humidifiers distribute air throughout a room using room-temperature water. This is either done with an evaporative model that uses a fan to blow the air out, or with an ultrasonic model that uses ultrasonic vibration technology to push the out air. Cool mist models tend to use less energy because they don’t have to use up electricity to heat the water before it releases the air. If you have children in your home, it’s recommended that you choose a cool mist model because there is less risk of burn injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Warm mist humidifiers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm mist humidifiers heat the water first before dispersing the air into a room. Although there is a higher burn danger, the warm mist models have the benefit of killing bacteria and mold. They can also make your room feel warmer, which could save you some heating costs in the winter. However, they use more electricity than the cool mist models because they need to first boil the water before releasing the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits for Your Health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of a humidifier comes with many health benefits. If the air in your home is too dry, breathing passages in your nose and lungs can dry out, causing irritation that can lead to nosebleeds, sinus infections and dry eye. It can also cause or aggravate chapped, dry and itchy skin, particularly for those with psoriasis. Humidifiers put moisture in the air that can help prevent such irritations. . They are also particularly beneficial to use during sleep and when you are sick because they can alleviate cold and flu symptoms, break up congestion and reduce asthma and allergy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should keep in mind though that too much humidity can also cause problems. If moisture levels get above 55-60 percent, it can cause condensation problems and spread mold and mildew. Maintaining the humidity in your home at about 35 - 45% avoids these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Benefits for Your Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much dry air in your home doesn’t just affect you and your family, but the structure of your home itself. Without enough humidity, structural beams and posts can shrink, causing your floors to sag. Hardwood floors, molding and valuable antiques can be ruined by low indoor humidity. Also, static electricity builds up, which can damage sensitive electronic gadgets and computer components. Using a humidifier can prevent this damage to your home, while also offering the added benefit of keeping your houseplants alive by keeping them from drying out. It can also save you money by allowing you to turn down your thermostat an extra one or two degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are several factors to consider around the type of humidifier to choose, they can all improve the health of you and your family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

"241","en","article","1","16","DIY Plumbing Tips Every Homeowner Should Know","1516852389","1623978746","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Plumbing can be intimidating, especially for newer homeowners. You may feel like you have no idea where to start when it comes to maintaining your plumbing system, and you might even be afraid to tinker with any of the parts. While it’s best to leave major plumbing projects to a professional, there are steps you can take to save water at home and prevent costly repairs. Take a look at these DIY plumbing and water saving tips to keep your home flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Install Low-Flow Toilets, Faucets &amp;amp; Shower Heads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great first step to optimizing your plumbing system is purchasing low-flow showerheads, faucets, and toilets. A 10-minute shower with a conventional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.home-water-works.org/indoor-use/showers&quot;&gt;showerhead can use up to 42 gallons of water&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on how many showers your family takes, that could mean thousands of gallons per year! Replacing your showerhead with a low-flow model is easy to do and only costs between $10 - $40. Low-flow faucets and aerators can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hgtv.com/remodel/interior-remodel/lower-bills-with-low-flow-faucets&quot;&gt;cut down your water consumption&lt;/a&gt; by up to 50 percent. You can replace the entire faucet for $100 - $200, or simply add an aerator for a few dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-flow toilets keep your water usage at a minimum, using up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poplarnetwork.com/news/payback-period-low-flow-toilets-cost-offset-water-savings&quot;&gt;20 percent less water&lt;/a&gt; with every flush. These toilets tend to be more expensive than regular models, but they can pay for themselves within a year via water bill savings. Choosing low-flow models can help both the environment and your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use a Strainer in Your Drains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are simple precautions you can take to prevent dangerous materials from going down your drains and damaging your pipes. Use strainers in your sink and bathtub drains to keep hair and soap out of your pipes and avoid expensive clogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, avoid using harsh chemical drain cleaners when a clog does happen: They are harmful to the environment and your pipes. Instead, try pouring one cup of baking soda into your drain followed by one cup of vinegar. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush out with boiling water. This natural remedy is effective and gentler on your pipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Keep Fats and Oils Out of Your Drains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other hazardous materials that clog up your pipes are fats and oils from cooking. When grease cools, it solidifies and sticks to the insides of your pipes. Over time, it will build up and block the entire pipe, which can cause serious sewer backups. These backups can affect your home and any Other hazardous materials that clog up your pipes are fats and oils from cooking. When grease cools, it solidifies and sticks to the insides of your pipes. Over time, it will build up and block the entire pipe, which can cause serious sewer backups. These backups can affect your home and any neighbours who share the same water supply. Next time you cook some delicious bacon for breakfast, let the grease cool, wipe it out with a paper towel, and toss it into your green bin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Check Your Toilet for Leaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not seem like a leaky toilet could impact your water usage too much, but in fact, one &lt;a href=&quot;http://codb.us/DocumentCenter/View/891&quot;&gt;leaky toilet can waste up to 200 gallons&lt;/a&gt; per day! If you have two toilets in your home, that could cost you hundreds of extra dollars a month. To test your toilet for leaks, drop some food colouring into the tank. If the colour seeps into the toilet bowl within 10 to 15 minutes, there is probably a leak. Be aware, there is a possibility the food dye stains your toilet tank. As for the leak, it’s likely that the toilet flapper needs to be replaced, which you can purchase for as little as $10 to $20. If replacing the flapper doesn’t fix the leak, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/protection-plans/plumbing-repair-protection-plan#blog&quot;&gt;call a plumber to have it professionally checked and repaired&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Be Careful What You Flush&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to protect your toilet is not to treat it like a trash can. The only things that should be flushed down your toilet are human waste and toilet paper. Items such as feminine hygiene products, wipes, paper towels, and diapers should always be placed in the trash. Dental floss is another item to keep out of your toilet. Today's dental floss is shed-resistant and won't break down. When these items enter the sewage system, it bonds with other waste and forms large clumps that block pipes. Also, do not flush hair to help avoid a backed up toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Turn Off Your Faucets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a leaky toilet, a leaky faucet can cause thousands of gallons of wasted water per year if not taken care of. First, make sure that you’re preventing any leaks by turning your tap off all the way each time you use a faucet in your home. If you turn it off completely and it continues to leak, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/plumbing/plumbing-repair#blog&quot;&gt;have it repaired or replaced by a plumber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in plumbing maintenance early can help you save money in the long run. Although some plumbing repairs are unavoidable, there is a lot you can do to prevent or minimize these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

For decades, many homeowners have used natural gas in a variety of ways including forced air systems. Natural gas is a preferred method of heating the home due to being reliable as well as efficient and convenient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural gas is a natural resource and an inexpensive way to heat the home. For decades, many homeowners have used natural gas in a variety of ways, including forced air systems. Natural gas is a preferred method of heating the home due to being reliable as well as efficient and convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural gas heat provides a warmer feel than what can be produced by electric heating. Forced-air systems used with natural gas heat to provide warmth from 55 to 60 degrees Celsius. With an electric heat pump, the temperatures would be from 25 to 45 degrees Celsius&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An Economical Choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any heating system is measured by the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) rating. The AFUE is a ratio of the amount of energy that goes into the system to the amount of energy that comes out in a form of usable heat. Heat lost is considered in this ratio. The higher the rating, the more energy-efficient the unit will be, saving you money on your monthly heating bills. New furnaces that operate on natural gas have the ability to use 98% of their energy input, which is an amazing way to remain economical while heating the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installing Natural Gas In Your Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning on installing natural gas in the home, it is important to ask an HVAC technician a few questions. You need to find out if natural gas is available in your area and how much the cost will be for the install, as well as to use the natural gas in the home. The cost of operating the system will, of course, vary based on the size of the home as well as unit type. By consulting with a professional HVAC technician, you can find options for your home that will help you to install a natural gas unit that is appropriate for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to consider if the installation process will include a ductwork system. This can be tied into a central air conditioning unit easily. This way, you can use natural gas for your heating element and an energy-efficient central unit for cooling the home. Doing this will allow you to have a quality form of comfort during the winter and summer months, saving money year-round as your systems will be highly energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is important to have your property reviewed by a professional. Whether you are considering a new home build or installing natural gas in your existing home, you need to have a top HVAC company take a look at your property for an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Enercare, we are happy to assist you with any heating or cooling need. Let our team of highly trained Energy Management Consultants provide you with a natural gas consultation. You may find out that your property is a perfect fit and you can have a natural gas heating system installed in your home!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching from Heat to Cool – Mode setting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The&amp;nbsp;Enercare&amp;nbsp;Smarter Home Thermostat has three comfort settings – HEAT, COOL and AUTO. You can set the thermostat to any of these settings at the thermostat, on the Smarter Home mobile app or&amp;nbsp;using&amp;nbsp;the Smarter Home dashboard on your computer. If you have chosen “Auto”, the thermostat will switch from the “Heat” to “Cool” settings&amp;nbsp;automatically, based on the pre-defined temperature. To manually switch to a different setting, you can press the mode button on the thermostat and cycle to the setting you would like to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Thermostat line drawing&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;4910b2ba-98f8-4f7c-9557-465a94a81c47&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/thermostat-with-descriptions_1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the best features of your Smarter Home Thermostat is the ability to adjust the temperatures to help you save money.&amp;nbsp; During the heating season, every degree you lower your temperature on your thermostat could save you up to 3%&amp;nbsp;on your heating bill.&amp;nbsp; If you are away for the day, setting the thermostat back to 15 degrees Celsius could help reduce your heating bill up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torontohydro.com/sites/electricsystem/electricityconservation/residentialconservation/pages/seasonalconservationtips.aspx&quot;&gt;20%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going away on vacation, you can set your thermostat to know when you are away and when you will return. It can be set up to adjust the temperature after you leave, keep it at your chosen temperature while you are away and adjust the temperature back to your ideal comfort levels&amp;nbsp;when you arrive back home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While away, you will receive notifications if your equipment has an issue or if the temperature has increased/decreased relative to a pre-defined temperature threshold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to close your blinds or curtains in the summer to help keep the heat out and open them in the winter to let the sunlight in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, be sure to change/clean your furnace filter every one to three months.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your new thermostat requires batteries as a backup. The thermostat will tell you when the battery levels are low&amp;nbsp;by flashing “LOW” then “BATT” on the display.&amp;nbsp;To replace the batteries, pull the thermostat unit off the wall and you’ll find the batteries in the back. It takes four AA batteries. Install the batteries in accordance with the polarity markings on the thermostat and always use new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the batteries have completely drained, the HVAC system could stay on or off which could cause issues in your home. We suggest replacing the batteries once a year to avoid corrosion from leaking batteries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Heating or Cooling Doesn’t Turn On When the Set Point is Above or Below the Room Temperature.&lt;br /&gt;
To avoid damaging the compressor, the thermostat inserts a delay when cycling the compressor. If you believe the system should be on but it’s not, then change the set point 2 degrees beyond the current set point and wait 5 minutes to see if the system turns on. If not, contact the Enercare Smarter Home team at 1-833-99-SMART.&lt;/p&gt;

Most units can last for a decade or more if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/ac-maintenance#blog&quot;&gt;keep up regular maintenance&lt;/a&gt;. However, over time, the system will need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know if your air conditioning unit needs to be replaced? Read on to learn common reasons that air conditioning units fail, what you can do to assess your unit, and what to look for in a new system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6 Reasons Why AC Units Fail&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broken air conditioner in the peak heat of summer is frustrating and uncomfortable. When you call a service technician about your unit, here are some common causes of a breakdown you can expect them to talk with you about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Old Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average air conditioner lifespan is 17 years. If your unit is getting up there in age, it’s likely time for a replacement. Over time, the system loses energy efficiency which means that you are paying more to cool your home than you would with a newer unit. Older systems may also need more repairs when old components wear out or break down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Frozen Coils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coils in your unit are what cools the warm air in your home. Dirt and other types of debris can clog the filters and ducts, restricting the warm air from reaching the coils. This prevents the coils from cooling the air efficiently, and may eventually cause the coils to freeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Refrigerant Leak&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refrigerant is the chemical found within the coils that help to cool the air. Without this chemical, air conditioning is not possible. If there is a refrigerant leak, then the unit is not getting enough of this essential cooling element to keep your system working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Overworked Capacitors and Contactors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capacitors and contactors work to keep essential motors running in the unit, such as the fan motor and blower motor. A significant amount of electricity runs through these parts, so they tend to get overheated and overworked—especially during hot summer months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Electrical Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of the wiring in the unit can decrease over time and affect your circuit breaker. This is likely due to the age of the unit but it’s also possible that the wiring was not set up correctly when your unit was first installed.&amp;nbsp;If you're unsure about the state of your wiring, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/electrical/electrical-repair#blog&quot;&gt;call a licensed electrician&lt;/a&gt; to check it out or make a repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Defective Thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the unit is not working due to other parts of the HVAC system. The thermostat is what measures the temperature and tells the air conditioning unit when to turn on and off. If the thermostat is not working properly, it may give false information to the AC unit which causes it to run when it shouldn’t or not turn on when it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting AC Unit Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things you can do to prevent or even fix certain issues with your unit. First, make sure you get your unit cleaned and inspected every year to prevent any significant issues from popping up. Second, take a look at your circuit breaker and fuse to make sure there aren’t any electrical issues affecting your unit. Third, replace your furnace filters every one to three months to keep them clean.&lt;br /&gt;
The majority of issues that can affect your unit should be checked out by a professional technician. Enercare’s expert technicians are available to perform &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/air-conditioner-repair#blog&quot;&gt;a free in-home evaluation to help you decide which repairs are needed&lt;/a&gt; to keep your unit working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Considerations When Replacing Your Unit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common question people have is when should they replace their AC unit. After a professional assessment, you may learn that your unit must be replaced entirely, or that it’s not worth the cost to repair it. Buying a new unit is a big decision since most units cost between $3,000-$10,000. Here are a few key things to consider when choosing an AC unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Age and Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, the average lifespan for an air conditioner unit is 17 years. If your unit is struggling to remain efficient and it’s close to that average age, say 12 years old or older, you might be surprised by the amount of money you could save with a new, more energy-efficient unit. In the past, the standard Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) was set at 10, but now the minimum is 13, and it can range up to 25.5. The higher the ratio, the lower your electrical consumption and energy bills for the same type of output. If you’re in a very hot climate, it’s recommended that you choose the highest SEER that you can afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Space Changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may think that you should just buy the same size unit that you already have, but if you’ve made any significant changes to your home, a bigger or smaller unit may be more appropriate. For example, if you built an addition to your home or added more insulation, the amount of cooling you need could be much different than when you first bought your unit. Make sure to hire a contractor to complete a proper load analysis to get an accurate measurement of your space and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/blog/air-conditioning/how-do-i-know-what-size-air-conditioner-i-need&quot;&gt;estimate what size air conditioner you need&lt;/a&gt; before making your selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;AC Replacement Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost is likely your biggest consideration, and fortunately, rebates are a way to help offset your bill. Depending on the type of unit you install, government and utility rebates may be available to help you save money on a new installation. At Enercare, we offer quality installation options that may &lt;a href=&quot;https://enbridgesmartsavings.com/home-energy-conservation&quot;&gt;include rebates from our partners&lt;/a&gt; so you can save money while taking advantage of a new more efficient unit. Our technicians will evaluate your current unit and see how a new system can better serve you. We will go over the options available to you, including rebates so that you can make a decision based on your cooling requirements as well as your budget needs.&lt;br /&gt;

"261","en","article","1","16","How Do I Know What Size Air Conditioner I Need?","1560347642","1620157216","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/new-air-conditioner#blog&quot;&gt;buying a new air conditioning system&lt;/a&gt;, it must be an appropriate size to handle your cooling needs. But how do you determine the right size of AC unit you need to efficiently cool your home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Air Conditioner Sizes are Measured&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s look at how air conditioner sizes are determined. An AC unit’s cooling capacity is measured in tons based on how many British Thermal Units (BTU) it can remove within an hour. For example, a one-ton unit can remove 12,000 BTU, a two-ton unit can remove 24,000 BTU and so on. Home air conditioners generally start at 1.5 tons and go up in half-ton increments. It is unlikely that your home would need a unit larger than five tons. There are some general guidelines you can use based on the square footage of your home to get a ballpark estimate of the unit size you may need.&amp;nbsp; For example, you can roughly estimate one-ton per 750-1000 square feet, so a 2,000 square foot home may require a 2.0 – 2.5-ton unit.&amp;nbsp; Remember though that many factors such as number and size of windows, exposure of those windows to the south and west, as well as how the home was insulated, will influence the unit size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things to Consider for Your Air Conditioner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the size estimates based on square footage are helpful to give you an idea of what to expect, several other factors go into properly sizing your air conditioning unit. To ensure that your home has a quality system installed, an Energy Management Consultant should complete a professional evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultant conducts an assessment of your home and focuses on various aspects, such as size and age of the home, ceiling height, number of windows, how much shade the house gets and the amount of insulation. The consultant will also consider the capacity and functionality of the existing HVAC system and the climate of your area. Once the assessment is complete, the consultant will give you an estimate to consider for several unit types. They will also help you understand how each unit can cool your home and will then help you make a decision based on your cooling needs and budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you can do as the homeowner is make a list of issues you currently have with your air conditioning unit and discuss what you find with the consultant. Here are a few questions to ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Is your current unit not cooling properly?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have you found that your system needs repairs quite often?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does the unit turn off even if the desired temperature setting is not reached yet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identified problems can help the consultant better determine a unit choice for your home&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/protection-plans/ac-protection-plan#blog&quot;&gt;if a protection plan is a good choice for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Importance of a Proper Size Air Conditioner&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing the correct size air conditioning unit for your home makes a significant impact on your comfort and energy bills. You might think that bigger is always better, but that is not the case. If you purchase an air conditioner that is too large, it will cool your space too rapidly. This will cause it to continuously shut off and turn back on, which leads to lower efficiency and higher costs and sometimes more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/air-conditioner-repair#blog&quot;&gt;air conditioner repairs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you choose a unit that is too small for your home, it will run constantly to cool the space, and in some cases may never achieve the desired temperature. This increases your costs and may leave you too warm in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing an air conditioning unit in your home is a big undertaking and choosing the wrong size unit can greatly impact your energy costs. That’s why we recommend leaving the process to the professionals in the HVAC industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every homeowner has the experience of opening an electricity bill in the summer months and being shocked at the total. It seems each year you have to spend more and more to keep your home cool enough to live in. For many homeowners, the air conditioner runs non-stop during those hot summer months, which means a higher electricity bill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what can you do to stay cool and save energy AND money this summer? Below are a few of our most effective home cooling and air conditioner tips to reduce electric bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Programmable Thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to save money on your electricity bill is with a programmable thermostat. These thermostats have the ability to be set for ideal temperatures during specific time periods. You can program the unit however you like, which can save you big bucks if you know what to do. Think about the times during the day when you are not at home and program the thermostat accordingly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer, you may go on vacation. While away, set your unit to a higher temperature or program it to turn off completely. You can set the system to turn back on before you arrive home so that your home is nice and cool, but you didn’t spend a ton of money leaving your air conditioner or HVAC running while you were away. The same can be said for while you are at work. Set it for a higher temperature so that your air conditioner is not constantly running while you are away from home during the day. This will help you see savings on your system each month when you receive your electricity bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Get Blackout Curtains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on where your home is situated, warmth coming directly from the sun can cause your home to be hotter than you’d like it to be. When the sun shines through your windows, it can heat up rooms quickly, which means the air conditioning system will stay on for a longer period of time. To combat this problem, consider hanging blackout curtains in your windows so that they block out the sunlight. With the light blocked, the room will not be as hot, which will lead to less usage of your air conditioning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Turn Off the Lights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not specific to the summer months, another cause of a high electricity bill is the lighting. Be sure to get in the habit of turning off lights when you are leaving a room or while you are away from home. Lighting is an added cost to your electricity bill and when combined with the electricity used by your air conditioning system, the cost can add up. Remind everyone in your home to turn off lights when not in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keep Your Vents Clear and Open&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may seem obvious, drapes, furniture, and household items can pile up around and on top of your air vents, reducing airflow. This includes your air return vents, as furniture pushed up against these may reduce your home’s air quality. The start of each new season, like summer, is an excellent time to check that your air vents are open in your main living areas and closed in areas like your basement that may not need the extra cooling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dirty ventilation systems can lead to clogged air conditioner coils and filters which reduce your system’s cooling efficiency and could even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/air-conditioner-repair#blog&quot;&gt;lead to a full air conditioner breakdown&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you know that it has been a while since your last &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/duct-cleaning&quot;&gt;duct cleaning service&lt;/a&gt;, add that to your to-do list.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these home cooling tips, you should start to see savings on your electricity bill during the summer months. At Enercare, we can assist by installing a programmable thermostat for your air conditioning unit or provide an estimate for a new air conditioning system.

&lt;p&gt;If you make the right choice, you’re rewarded with a comfortable home, potentially lower energy bills and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling#blog&quot;&gt;cooling system&lt;/a&gt; that won’t break down prematurely. If you make the wrong choice, you may face higher installation costs, untimely repairs, expensive energy bills, and a cooling system that may not cool your home efficiently or effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious about how to find the perfect option? Here are four steps to simplify your central AC buying experience and help you make a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Central Air Conditioner Purchase &amp;amp; Installation Tips to Know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s cover the basics of AC installation to make sure a central air conditioner is a good fit for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support a central cooling system, your home must have a furnace or air handler with ductwork. Installing a new air conditioner in a home with existing properly sized ductwork will cost approximately $3,500-$6,000 depending on size, efficiency, AC unit type and personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have the infrastructure to support a central unit, call a professional to install ductwork for you or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/buyers-guide-air-conditioners#DuctlessAC&quot;&gt;learn more about ductless systems&lt;/a&gt; in our AC Buyer’s Guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the basics covered, let’s dive into the steps you should take to choose a central air conditioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Determine What Size Air Conditioner You Require&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the perfect AC unit for your home, there are nearly a dozen factors to consider that can make a significant impact on your comfort and energy bills. The biggest factor for determining your ideal unit size is how large your home is, but you also must consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The age of your home&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Construction materials&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Airflow and duct size tolerances&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The number and size of windows&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Insulation amount, type and age&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much sun your house gets and where the sun strikes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even two homes with identical floor plans and building materials can have different cooling needs. For example, nearby trees could add additional shade to one house and not the other, which means one house is naturally cooler than its neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors can make-or-break how effective your air conditioner is and what unit size you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners are measured in tons which describes the cooling capacity. To &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/blog/air-conditioning/how-do-i-know-what-size-air-conditioner-i-need&quot;&gt;get a rough estimate on the size of ac unit you need&lt;/a&gt;, you can compare your home’s square footage with AC unit cooling capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A one-ton AC unit provides adequate cooling for roughly 600-800 square feet. Most central air conditioners start at 1.5 tons and increase in half-ton increments. In Ontario, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/190503/dq190503b-eng.htm&quot;&gt;the average single-family home is 1,520 square feet&lt;/a&gt;, so you’re likely looking to buy a 2.0-ton unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to discover the best cooling solutions for your home—with every factor accounted for—we suggest you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/new-air-conditioner#blog&quot;&gt;schedule a free air conditioner consultation&lt;/a&gt; with Enercare’s HVAC experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Happens if I Buy and Install the Wrong AC Unit Size?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the correct size air conditioning unit can impact your equipment's lifespan, energy expenses, and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undersized unit can’t keep up with heat and humidity removal, while an oversized unit won’t allow the cooling system to run long enough to dehumidify the whole home. Both undersized and oversized units cause uneven air distribution, and higher energy and repair costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table style=&quot;border: 1px solid #000; width: 100%; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr style=&quot;border: 1px solid #000; width: 100%;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; border-right: 1px solid #000; height: 50px; font-weight: 400;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;Undersized Unit&lt;/th&gt;
			&lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid #000; border-right: 1px solid #000; height: 50px; font-weight: 400;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;Oversized Unit&lt;/th&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td style=&quot;border-right: 1px solid #000; width: 50%; vertical-align: top;&quot;&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Constantly running leading to greater wear and tear&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Higher energy costs&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Shorter equipment lifespan&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Inability to provide enough cooling&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
			&lt;ul&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Higher installation costs&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;AC is not running long enough, causing more breakdowns&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Not enough dehumidification - the house will feel cold but clammy&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;Large temperature swings&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Choose the Type of Central Air Conditioner You Want&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to choose among the three common types of central AC units in Canada. The most notable differences between each type are price points and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Types of Central Air Conditioners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Single-Stage Condensers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single-stage condensers are either off or operating at full capacity. Single-stage air conditioners can be a great entry-level choice, but if you want a high-efficiency option, this may not be the right fit for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dual-Stage Condensers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need an air conditioner that operates in two modes, consider a dual-stage unit. Dual-stage air conditioners run at a lower or higher rate depending on the weather. These settings help your air conditioner run more efficiently than a single-stage unit and cost less than a variable speed unit. If you’re looking to make an upgrade to a dual-stage condenser, your HVAC expert should be checking that the indoor furnace or air handler, evaporator coil and thermostat are compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Variable Speed Condensers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variable speed air conditioners run throughout the day in longer cycles instead of shutting on and off to match your desired temperature. Variable speed units offer you better energy efficiency than the other two types but are the priciest of the three choices. To install this type of condenser, you need to have a matched system. A matched system is one where the condenser, furnace/air handler, evaporator coil and thermostat have been made by the same manufacturer and are designed to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Choose an Energy Efficiency Rating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy-efficient equipment tends to cost more money upfront, but down the line, an efficient cooling system can reduce your monthly energy bills and your carbon footprint. When it comes to budget, it is important to understand how energy efficiency is measured in order to find the right balance for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How Is Energy Efficiency Measured?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) uses various seasonal temperatures to measure how efficient your air conditioning equipment or system is, similar to the kilometers-per-liter rating for a car. Some air conditioners come with an EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio). An EER is comparable to SEER but uses a steady outdoor temperature to calculate your air conditioner's efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher the equipment's SEER and EER rating, the more energy-efficient the AC unit is, and the more comfortable your home will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most commonly installed units in Ontario range from 13-16 SEER, but ultimately, your unit's energy rating comes down to personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Choose a Provider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand the various central air conditioner sizes, types, and energy ratings, it is time to choose a provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your AC installer must have product knowledge and experience with HVAC systems and be able to walk you through the steps outlined in this article. Before you sign an installation contract, we recommend learning about the company’s installation services, costs of service, payment options, and warranties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of licenses your installer must have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gas license&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;313a refrigeration or 313d residential air conditioning license&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ozone Depletion Prevention (ODP) license&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ESA permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

"276","en","article","1","16","Carbon monoxide poisoning – the silent killer","1516813620","1568391148","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide is a terrifying reality. Find out how to protect your family by reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is carbon monoxide?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide is an odourless and colourless gas that can cause serious health problems if inhaled. Carbon monoxide can rapidly accumulate in the blood, reducing blood&amp;#39;s ability to carry oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may suffer from: headaches, nausea, general lethargy, dizziness, or flu-like symptoms that appear to get better when you are away from the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Where does carbon monoxide come from?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide is a by-product of burning fossil fuels including natural gas, oil, propane, and wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your home, a fireplace or a furnace can be sources of carbon monoxide, but if installed properly and maintained regularly, they will produce very little as a by-product. Carbon monoxide becomes an issue if your venting is blocked or if your heating equipment is damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defective heat exchanger in a furnace can also be a source of carbon monoxide. The danger arises if carbon monoxide escapes from the defective heat exchanger and mixes with the air circulated through the vents in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What can I do to prevent carbon monoxide in my home?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure you have working carbon monoxide detectors inside your home. It is recommended to have one in your basement near any heating equipment and others on the main and/or second level of your home. Carbon monoxide detectors are available at most home improvement stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Seek professional assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a qualified technician inspect and clean your fuel-burning appliances yearly before the cold weather sets in to ensure they are in good working order.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a qualified technician inspect chimneys and vents yearly for cracks, blockages (for example, bird&amp;#39;s nests, twigs, old mortar), corrosion or holes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check your fireplaces for closed or blocked flues.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check with a qualified technician before enclosing any heating or gas burning hot water equipment in a smaller room, to ensure there is adequate air for proper combustion.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never use propane or natural gas stove tops, ovens or barbecues to heat your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of October 2014, there are laws that make it mandatory for most Ontario homes which have at least one fuel-burning appliance, like a gas furnace or gas water heater, to have a carbon monoxide detector installed.

"281","en","article","1","16","Troubleshooting clogged drains","1516814487","1624926275","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of things that you can do before calling a plumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Typical reasons why drains get clogged&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Clogged drain pipes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gunk accumulates on the walls of drain pipes and reduces water flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes:&amp;nbsp;Dirt,&amp;nbsp;skin flakes, hair binding to soap scum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove and clean the drain stopper.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Next, try using a plunger, remembering to block the overflow drain in the tub or sink.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If that doesn't work, remove the drain elbow joint and clean it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to prevent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clean drain stoppers routinely to prevent clogs and use a hair strainer drain-cover to trap hair before it goes down the drain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Clogged toilets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flushing items that do not dissolve or break apart in water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items:&amp;nbsp;Feminine hygiene products, cotton-tipped swabs, dental floss, pre-moistened diaper wipes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Try using a plunger to shoot jets of water to clear the drain pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Next, use an inexpensive hand-powered drain auger to reach between 2 to 5 ft. down the toilet's drain pipe and break up or retrieve whatever is blocking the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to prevent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Only flush waste and paper that readily dissolve in water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clean toilets regularly to keep water flowing smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Clogged kitchen sinks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leftover food and fat gets caked onto the drain pipe wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes:&amp;nbsp;Cooking grease or oil, detergent soap scum, un-dissolved food particles such as rice (which expand in water)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Run very hot water down the drain to soften the clog, followed by a dollop of dish detergent and then more hot water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wait a few minutes, then use a plunger and repeat the hot water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you still have no luck, you may want to use a chemical drain opener, but use caution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to prevent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dispose of large amounts of kitchen grease and oil by letting them solidify. Scrape the mess into a plastic bag, seal it, and throw it out with the garbage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Small amounts of oil (less than one cup) should be thoroughly diluted with hot water and dish detergent before being poured into the sink.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For ongoing clogged or slow drains, have a plumber inspect the plumbing to determine if the drain line was properly designed and installed. Both drain pipe venting and slope affect how well drains work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Clogged vent pipe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sink gurgles when you flush the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes:&amp;nbsp;Not enough air getting into the vent pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check that nothing is blocking the vent pipe opening on your roof, like a bird or animal nest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check under sinks for gulp valves, typically mounted at the end of a drain line - they look like a plastic cap from a can of spray paint. (The valve prevents sewer gas from escaping the drain line but lets air into the vent pipe when there's enough suction.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fill the sink with water and then drain it out all at once. You should hear air getting sucked into the gulp valve. If not, the valve might need to be replaced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Venting allows sewer gases to escape and prevents them from building to dangerous levels inside your home.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/plumbing/plumbing-repair#blog&quot;&gt;Contact Enercare professional plumbers for repair immediately&lt;/a&gt;, if there is a constant odour of raw sewage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Clogged main drain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slope determines how well wastewater is carried to the sewer line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Too much slope: water can run too fast and leave waste material behind. Over time, the buildup forms a blockage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Too little slope: water and waste pool in the pipe, allowing some waste to settle and form a blockage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troubleshooting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove any blockages with a plumbers' snake and then flush out the pipe with water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to prevent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a plumber install a new pipe set at the proper slope to carry sewage away more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Around the house&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure bathroom and outdoor power outlets are equipped with Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never poke fingers, toys, or anything else into wall outlets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not overload circuits, and use a power strip for heavy usage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use electrical cords with a third (ground) prong. Never try to remove the third prong.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not plug or unplug electrical appliances, tools, or equipment with wet hands or in wet conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not insert any metal implement into an electrical appliance while it is plugged in.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replace damaged or frayed power cords.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never attempt to disconnect your power meter, as it could explode.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/protection-plans/electrical-protection-plan&quot;&gt;Always have a qualified electrician perform any electrical work&lt;/a&gt;, including connecting an emergency or backup generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Outside the house&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;Before doing any work near power lines, know where all power lines are located.&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before digging or driving posts into the ground, call your utility provider.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure swimming pools are situated well away from power lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not plant trees where they will grow into power lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install antennas away from power lines at a distance that is at least equal to the height of the antenna, plus 3 yards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Power lines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take great care to avoid overhead power lines, especially when performing activities, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Using a ladder&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pruning or cutting trees&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cleaning a pool&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Installing or removing an antenna&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Working on the roof&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Carrying long tools or pipes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Setting up and moving scaffolding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, including rubber gloves, will protect you from the voltages carried by overhead power lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Danger zones&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Always be on the lookout for fallen or sagging wires, especially after storms.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stay away from downed power lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never play around power substations, poles, towers, fences, or trees near power lines or electrical equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never fly kites near overhead power lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never spray water guns or hoses at power lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never try to open, or poke sticks or other objects into underground transformer boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stay out of substations and areas marked 'Keep Out' or 'Danger'. If a ball or toy lands in a high voltage area, call your electric utility to retrieve it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid going outdoors during a lightning storm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the temperatures dropping and colder months ahead, it’s important to make sure the inner workings of your home are running efficiently, but some tasks may seem daunting. Plumbing can be one of the most intimidating areas of home maintenance and it can also be one of the most costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frozen pipes are one of the most common problems homeowners encounter during the winter, and there are simple things that can be done to avoid this from occurring. Dave Walton, Director of Home Ideas at Enercare Home Services, offers these simple tips to help keep your plumbing working efficiently, even in the coldest months:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Avoid freezing pipes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time to insulate your plumbing. Look for cracks in insulation surrounding the basement wall, attic, crawl spaces and garage, and use pipe covers or expandable foam insulation to fill them. This will keep cold wind from affecting your pipes.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Fix leaking faucets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to fix leaking taps right away because just one leaking faucet can waste almost 130 litres per year.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Prepare outdoor water faucets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to prepare your faucets for winter. By disconnecting the hose, turning off the inside shut off-valve, and leaving the outside faucet in the &quot;on&quot; position for the winter, you will release the pressure in your pipes, and help prevent any potential issues.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Get familiar with your plumbing system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you know where your main waterline valve is so that you are prepared if any problems arise.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Prepare your home before you go on vacation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning to be away for an extended period of time, make sure to turn the water off at the main service valve and open the taps to drain water from your plumbing in case&amp;nbsp;the temperature&amp;nbsp;drops while you’re gone. It’s also a good idea to ask a neighbour to check on your home periodically.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your pipes have already suffered damage from freezing, call Enercare for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/plumbing/plumbing-repair#blog&quot;&gt;plumbing repair quote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"296","en","article","1","11","Celebrate World Plumbing Day on March 11","1516815290","1568406593","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Water consumption is important every day, not just World Plumbing Day. Find out how to save a lot of water by making small changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 11, people around the world will join together to promote World Plumbing Day, an annual event to recognize the role of plumbing in improving health and safeguarding the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind today – and always – that when it comes to water conservation, small adjustments can have a big impact. &amp;nbsp;Here are some simple plumbing tips to help you&amp;nbsp;cut down on daily water use, conserve energy and save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Fix your fixtures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Household leaks can waste up to 340 litres of water per day and can add 10 percent to your monthly water bill1. To avoid wasting water, make sure you turn your taps off all the way. If your taps continue to leak, have them repaired or replaced by a professional. Remember that most leaks get worse over time and having them repaired quickly is the best way to save water and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Reduce water usage in the shower&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-flow showerheads are inexpensive and can significantly reduce water consumption. These water-saving showerheads use about 7 litres per minute, whereas inefficient models use about 19 litres per minute. Also try setting a shower timer to ensure you are efficient with your time. Shortening your shower for only two minutes can cut water use by 38 litres2 .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Diagnose a leaky toilet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A leaky toilet can waste up to 757 litres of water each day, which is equivalent to 50 flushes. To test your toilet for leaks, drop some food colouring into the tank. If you see the colour seep in within 10 to 15 minutes, your tank has a leak3 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Wash dishes efficiently&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dishwasher uses less water than hand washing dishes in the sink. To conserve even more water and energy, try not to pre-rinse, wash only full loads and use the air-dry setting if you have one. Newer, more efficient dishwashers use 22 litres or less of water per cycle, whereas older models can use up to 60 litres2.&amp;nbsp;Consider upgrading your equipment to save water, and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Modify your bedtime and wake up routine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face washing and teeth brushing usually involves a running tap. Simply turning off the faucet while you brush your teeth or dry your face can save up to 30 litres of water in one use3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Listen to your toilet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gurgling toilet could be a sign that something is going wrong in the toilet tank or that underground roots are growing and placing pressure on your main drain. If you suspect a problem, have a professional fix it before your pipes break and must be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;If you see a downed power line. Remember these simple but important tips:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	1. Keep your distance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Never touch it with your hand or any other object, under any circumstance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stay at least 15 yards away from a downed power line or other damaged facility.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remember the voltage on the ground is highest in the area immediately around the electrical source and decreases with distance. Walking over the area can cause a fatal shock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. If you feel a tingling sensation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stop immediately, place your feet together and shuffle or hop out of the area without touching anything with your hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. If you are driving a vehicle that touches a downed power line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You are generally safe as long as you stay in the vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Others outside the vehicle are safe if they stay back at least 15 yards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. If you are able to drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slowly move at least 15 yards clear of the downed power line and any pools of water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. If you are unable to drive the vehicle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stay inside until the electric utility company arrives to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. If you must leave the vehicle due to immediate danger (such as a vehicle fire)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Jump out of the vehicle with your feet together. Avoid touching the car and the ground at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shuffle or hop away to a safe distance, at least 15 yards from the vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plumbing systems are an important part of the home. We all rely on plumbing in the home for a number of obvious purposes, such as bathing, cleaning and drinking. The plumbing system provides water to your laundry room, bathroom and kitchen, making it easy for you to access water for daily needs. When a plumbing system is maintained properly, the daily water needs of the home are not disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Benefits of Hiring a Plumber&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many reasons you would hire a plumber include to have a toilet replaced, new faucets installed or other plumbing installations. &amp;nbsp;With repairs, it is best to leave the fixing to the experts. If you try to DIY a plumbing project, you can end up doing more harm than good. Plumbers can assist with a variety of issues from frozen plumbing pipes to drain problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid trying to install new toilets or faucets yourself and let the experts complete the task with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What to keep handy at all times&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep candles and matches on hand. Have solid, stable holders for them, and be especially careful if there are children or pets around.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have a fire extinguisher nearby and know how to use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When the lights go out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Determine whether it is really a power outage or a problem with your own breaker.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check your main electrical panel. If you have blown a fuse or tripped a breaker, one or more of the switches may be turned off. Turn it back on and power should be restored.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If it is not a fuse or a breaker, check to see whether power is out for your neighbours, too. Power can be lost in a very localized area.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If it is an outage, call your utility company and report it. They may already know about the problem and be&amp;nbsp;working to fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Telecommunications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Purchase a phone that only needs to plug into a phone jack - not an electrical outlet. Cordless phones or extension phones that need electricity will not work during power outages.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use a battery-powered radio to keep up with the news. Make sure you have extra batteries.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use your car radio in an emergency, but don’t keep the car running in an enclosed garage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Turn off your appliances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to turn off appliances you were using when the power went out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Protect your appliances.&amp;nbsp;When power returns, there will be a surge of electrical energy that could damage sensitive equipment like computers, laptops, or televisions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Protect yourself.&amp;nbsp;During an outage, it is easy to forget that you had a stove burner or an iron on. If you're not home when power is restored, you could have a serious safety hazard.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Helping your utility to restore service.&amp;nbsp;Restarting appliances can use almost double the amount of electricity that they use when running normally. This demand can cause breakers to trip. Don't have all your appliances waiting to draw power the instant it is restored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to turn off appliances without power:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unplug them one by one. Leave a light on to let you know when electricity has been restored. Be careful not to miss an appliance or get injured moving around in the dark.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off your main circuit breaker.&amp;nbsp;This way, you won’t overlook anything, but you will have to keep an eye on streetlights to let you know that power has been restored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Stay cool&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hot weather, if the outage is likely to be prolonged. Use these tips to keep cool as your house heats up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Drink plenty of water - your body stays cool more efficiently when well hydrated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye on young children and the elderly for signs of heat exhaustion. Call 9-1-1 in case of a medical emergency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go to the basement. It is often cooler than the rest of the house.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dress in loose, light clothing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Draw drapes or cover south-facing windows with blankets to keep the sun out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep a window slightly open for a breeze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Think safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not run extension cords to a neighbour who still has power. It is a fire hazard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rethink standby generators&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A standby generator can be extremely dangerous if it is not connected properly and operated knowledgeably.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Residential consumers probably do not need a standby generator to cope with shorter outages.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For a prolonged outage, you will need to have stored enough fuel to operate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspecting your ducts for signs of&amp;nbsp;dirt, dust &amp;amp; grime is important to do on a regular basis.&amp;nbsp; Here are some of the signs you should look for to see if your ducts need cleaning.&amp;nbsp; Cleaned ducts can have a positive impact on your families health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do you need your ducts cleaned?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall is a great time to get your home ready for the winter months before we move indoors to avoid the cold and snow. With people about to spend the majority of their time inside, maintaining indoor air quality is essential to a healthy home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing your list of fall to-dos, don’t forget about your ductwork. Even though you can’t see what’s hiding inside your ducts, they could be housing things like mold, fungus, pet hair, construction debris, food, small toys and other debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, not only will the air you’re inhaling at home be unclean, the dirt and dust will restrict your HVAC system from working efficiently, causing you to use more energy to heat your home in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are 5 quick hints and tips that a duct cleaning may be required:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Pull up a vent cover and look inside&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the easiest way to see if there’s dirt, dust, pet hair or debris built up in the registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Vent cover removed from floor&quot; data-caption=&quot;Dirt, dust, debris and pet hair can collect inside the vent cover.&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;ea77c95b-d442-47fb-9d3c-56269ab87b4b&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/duct_cleaning_pull_vent_cover.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. Look at the return air registers.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;If there is a buildup of dirt, particularly thick, fuzzy coatings of dust, this is an indicator that a Duct Cleaning is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Pull out the air filter&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Judging from the condition of the filter, this could be a telltale sign a Duct Cleaning is required. If you find it’s clogged with dust, your airflow is likely being blocked off, which causes dust to build up in the return ductwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare technician comparing two furnace air filters&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;401015c9-45c9-4f7c-8212-d7de5d99cd66&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/duct_cleaning_air_filter.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[The air filter is an important piece of the ductwork in your home.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Get a furnace maintenance inspection&lt;/strong&gt;. When your Enercare Technician completes a maintenance inspection, they will tell you about the condition of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;/heating/furnace-maintenance&quot;&gt;furnace&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If there are large amounts of dust and dirt in the&amp;nbsp;motor, fan and components, this could mean you need a duct cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Check your AC coil&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;A plugged and dirty air conditioner coil is a sign the air filter is not working and a Duct Cleaning might be required.&lt;/p&gt;

"321","en","article","1","16","How to use your Enercare Smarter Home Leak Sensor as a temperature sensor","1543008611","1593729915","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;The Enercare Smarter Home Leak Sensor can double as a temperature sensor, sending information to your thermostat and ultimately to the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app. When you select your leak sensor, your Enercare Smarter Home Smart Thermostat will use this&amp;nbsp;temperature reading as a point of reference to heat or cool your home. When selecting your leak sensor along with other temperature sensors in your home, your temperature is averaged between the selected devices and will tell your system to run your heating or cooling based on this average.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have completed the installation of your Enercare Smarter Home Leak Sensor, you will find the available leak sensor listed under 'devices' through the Enercare Smarter Home Portal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here's how to use your Enercare Smarter Home Leak Sensor as a temperature sensor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select the 'Temperatures' card and a list of your active thermostats will be displayed under 'Devices'.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the thermostat, click the grey thermometer icon and check off the leak sensor(s) you wish to use. Your temperature system will automatically calibrate and use this sensor as a point of reference for your heating and cooling needs. If more than one box is checked at a time, your thermostat will use the average between the two temperatures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using your Enercare Smarter Home Leak Sensor as a temperature sensor in the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the menu, select 'Thermostat'.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select 'Temperature Sensors' and select the leak sensor(s) you wish to activate and then click 'Save' at the top right corner. Your temperature system will automatically calibrate and use these sensors as a point of reference for your heating and cooling needs. If more than one box is checked at a time, your thermostat will use the average between the two temperatures as the point of reference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to enable temperature averaging for your leak sensors through your set schedules in the Enercare Smarter Home Portal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click on the 'Temperatures' card and select 'Schedules' located at the top of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose the schedule you wish to add the leak sensor(s) to and click the pencil icon below it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A pop-up will display with all the available sensors. Select the check-box to the left of the leak sensor(s) you wish to activate and click 'OK'. Temperature averaging is now enabled for that schedule.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that when your other schedule&amp;nbsp;is turned on, it will automatically overwrite the selection chosen from the thermostat card. This means that if you manually set your home's temperature to your leak sensor&amp;nbsp;but the schedule is set to the thermostat, once your schedule is enabled it will automatically overwrite the manual selection and link your furnace to the thermostat rather than the leak sensor that was enabled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to activate your Enercare Smarter Home Leak Sensor as a temperature sensor through the Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your leak sensor has not been activated yet, please follow these instructions to get started:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home Portal.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the menu, select 'Settings' and then click 'Devices'.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A pop-up will appear with a list of all the Enercare Smarter Home automation devices. Click 'Devices' located on the left side of the pop-up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the list of available sensors, click the check box next to the leak sensor you wish to activate and then click 'Save'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your leak sensor can now be used as a temperature sensor. When multiple temperature sensors are activated at a time, your system will average the temperature of the selected devices. This averaged temperature is what your system will use as a point of reference for your cooling and heating equipment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to activate your Enercare Smarter Home Leak Sensor as a temperature sensor through the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click the menu icon located at the top left corner and then select 'Thermostats'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click 'Temperature Sensors' and a list of active sensors connected to your Enercare Smarter Home will display.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click the check box to the left of the leak sensor(s)&amp;nbsp;to activate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your leak sensor can now be used as a temperature sensor. When multiple temperature sensors are activated at a time, your system will average the temperature of the selected device.

"326","en","article","1","11","Saving water in your home","1516739002","1568408264","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Water is a precious resource that should not be wasted. Read our tips on how to be water-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tub and shower tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Showering generally uses less water than bathing in a tub.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leave a timer in the bathroom to help keep showers short and sweet.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fill the tub only one-quarter full, if you prefer bathing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Soak your shower head in vinegar to remove mineral deposits. Tie a bag filled with vinegar around the shower head with a long twist tie. Let it soak all day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install a low-flow shower head and faucet aerators.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Insulate all the hot water pipes in your home to keep hot water warmer for longer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use a bucket to collect water that runs while the shower heats up so you can use it for cleaning/chores.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off the water when you brush your teeth or shave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Toilet tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don’t flush things like cotton swabs, dental floss or hair down the toilet. This wastes water and can clog your sewer lines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check your flapper valve. If you hear your toilet filling without having been flushed, it could be leaking.&amp;nbsp;Put a few drops of food colouring into the toilet tank water.&amp;nbsp;Wait 10-15 minutes. If you see the coloured water in the toilet without flushing, then the flapper valve ought to be replaced to avoid wasting water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider a dual-flush toilet. They use different means to flush liquid and solid waste. Follow the manufacturer’s recommended schedule for routine maintenance of&amp;nbsp;dual flush toilets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Laundry tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use a full load in the washing machine (but don't overfill). Too much water will cause the washer to work less efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don’t waste water on small loads. Three-quarters full leaves room for the clothes to move around the agitator and reduces the chance for wrinkles or damage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use the right amount of detergent per load. Check the manufacturer's handbook as a guide.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use the pre-soak option for heavily-soiled loads. You’ll use less energy and water than washing the same load twice.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leave your washer open to dry for an hour or two after the last load to cut mold growth. Clean your washer once a month to remove mildew or soap scum.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider updating your washer with a newer, high-efficiency model.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/products/categories/appliances/clothes-washer/13984&quot;&gt;New ENERGY STAR® qualified models use less energy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;overall, and half as much water than ENERGY STAR® qualified washers made before January 1, 2007.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Leak tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Repair dripping faucets and leaky valves.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check your water meter periodically to monitor for leaky plumbing. If you see dial movement when no water is on, look for signs of leaks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the shut off valves under sinks. Look for water dripping from the valve stems as well as water stains on the floor or cabinet base.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check valves and hose connections behind washing machines, dishwashers, and bypass humidifiers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inspect connections to well pumps, pressure tanks, softeners, filters, boilers, and water heaters. If there is excessive corrosion, get them replaced by a professional.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure that water lines supplying outdoor hose bibs are emptied before winter, that the pipe inside is insulated, and the outside faucet has an insulated hose bib cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Yard tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Water lawns, shrubs, trees and gardens wisely. Many plants can be watered at the end of the day when heat is lower and evaporation will be reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set up a rain barrel at the bottom of a downspout to collect rain water. This water is safe to water shrubs, flowers, trees, and vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use mulch around shrubs, flowers, trees, and vegetables to retain moisture in the soil while reducing weeds and the use of herbicides.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reduce the size of your lawn by replacing it with native plants. They replace nutrients like nitrogen that grasses take out. You get better soil, a more diverse and disease-resistant yard, and use much less water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

"346","en","article","1","46","Holiday home safety","1516831948","1593722177","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Here is a great list of tips to keep your house safe over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winter holidays can be a joyous time filled with home decorating, festive cheer and spending quality time with family and friends. Although this is a time for fun and celebration, it is important to be aware of the increased risks and hazards during the holidays. Here are some helpful tips on how you can stay safe this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Be cautious with holiday lights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although electrical safety is a year-round concern, the use of decorative lights during the holiday season increases the risk of fire and electrical injuries. &amp;nbsp;Before draping holiday lights outside or inside your home, inspect lights and cords for fraying or cracks and be sure to replace any damaged cords and bulbs. Avoid running cords through walls, floors and ceilings where they can be pinched, and do not leave cords under carpets or in heavy traffic areas of your home. When you plug in decorations and lights, do not overcrowd electrical outlets and extension cords which can overheat and cause a fire. It is important to shut off all lights and unplug decorations before leaving the house or going to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Don't&amp;nbsp;post your travel plans on social media&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your travel plans off of social networks. Posting the location and length of your trip on sites such as Twitter and Facebook might seem like an exciting way to share your plans, but it can be risky. This type of information could alert criminals to when your house will be empty. Even if there are privacy safeguards on your accounts, personal information is still accessible and you do not know who in your network is sharing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Cook safely in the kitchen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When family and friends get together for the holidays, food is typically the most important ingredient. Holiday cooking can be a recipe for disaster if you do not exercise a great deal of safety when preparing food for a house full of guests. &amp;nbsp;Do not leave food that is grilling or frying unattended, and if you are leaving something in the oven for an extended period of time, use a timer to ensure your food does not overcook. It is helpful to organize your menu and prepare dishes ahead of time to avoid any clutter or accidents on the day of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Be careful of door-to-door solicitors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holiday cheer can make you feel generous and more willing to open your doors to friendly strangers, but be careful-this feeling can also leave you more vulnerable. These individuals may disguise themselves as charitable agents, so it is important to take the necessary precautions before giving blindly. Ask to see I.D. to verify their affiliation to the charity. If they cannot produce this, it could be a scam. Also, tell them you will donate online which gives you time to verify that the charity is legitimate. If you are at all concerned for your safety, call 911 immediately. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Ensure your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are functioning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are entertaining during the holidays, make sure smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are installed on each level of your home and frequently check the batteries to test that they are working. A busy home can be distracting, and with the increase of fire hazards during the holidays, it is important to be prepared in case of a fire. Make sure your home is equipped with a working fire extinguisher and ensure that guests are familiar with your fire escape plan procedures. &amp;nbsp;If your carbon monoxide or smoke detector starts going off, have everyone leave the house and call 911 immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milder temperatures are here, meaning the snow and ice that has accumulated on or around your home this winter will begin to melt away. Before spring arrives, it is important to take steps to prevent any potential water damage to your home.&amp;nbsp;Follow these simple tips to ensure your home is ready for this year’s spring thaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Use a shovel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove snow away from your home’s foundation. As the snow melts, it can leak into the foundation and cause a flood in your home. The potential damage can be very disruptive and costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Seal those cracks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walk around your home and identify cracks in the foundation that can occur due to moisture that has built up over the winter months. Be sure to repair and seal cracks to prevent any further damage or leaks. If the cracks seem significant, call a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Clean eavestroughs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eavestroughs are vital for protecting against water damage as they are the primary source for directing water from your roof away from your home. Melting snow or ice will not drain properly if eavestroughs are clogged and can cause significant damage to your roof and the foundation of your home. Clear eavestroughs of any debris that has built up over the winter or consider installing a screen guard to prevent debris from entering the eavestrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Check your sump pump&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have one, a sump pump is typically located in a pit in the basement and collects water from melting snow or heavy rain and pumps it outside before it can reach the floor level of your home. If the sump pump isn’t working properly, it could cause your basement to flood. Test your sump pump by dumping a bucket of water into the sump. This will raise the float and if the pump turns on and the water drains, your system is functioning. Also, be sure to inspect for any debris and clean the pump inlet screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Protect against ice damming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ice damming occurs during the winter when heat is transferred from your poorly insulated attic to the roof. The snow melts to the edge of the roof and then freezes when it hits the lower edge or soffit of the roof. If you’ve noticed the presence of large icicles around the edge of your roof this winter, have a professional conduct an inspection of your attic for heat leaks. A common renovation like installing pot-lights in the ceiling can really impact the warm air escaping into the attic. Come spring thaw, these leaks can be a source of water damage to your home.&lt;/p&gt;

Water allows us to cook, clean, water plants and do much more. Unfortunately, these tasks become &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;challenging if your home has hard water. If you have hard water, people often recommend that you get a water softener to manage your home’s water quality. But what exactly is hard water? How do you know if your home has it? And how does a water softener work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Signs of Hard Water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water often has high levels of magnesium and calcium from rocks and minerals in the ground, which can lead to hard water. If you have hard water, then soap and detergent are no longer as effective so you may see spots or buildup on your dishes and clothes. You may also feel a film on your skin after a shower due to the soap not fully dissolving and your hair may be dry or brittle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your home’s plumbing system can also be negatively affected. Deposits of calcium and magnesium can build up in your pipes, which can lead to a reduced flow of water, clogging and mineral deposits around faucets and shower heads. This buildup will cause your appliances and pipes to become inefficient, which can result in &lt;a href=&quot;/plumbing/plumbing-repair&quot;&gt;repairs or replacements earlier than normally necessary&lt;/a&gt;. Hard water can often be found in homes with private wells and homes on the city water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to Fix Hard Water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to hard water in the home is a water softener. A water softener&amp;nbsp; is an appliance that connects directly to your home’s water supply. The water softener system will replace the minerals that cause hard water with the sodium ions found in salt to make the water softer. This process is known as ion exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ion exchange to function properly, the water softener relies on a mineral tank filled with resin or zeolite beads that carry a negative charge while the unwanted minerals have a positive charge. As the hard water moves through the tank, the minerals cling to the resin or zeolite beads trapping the minerals in the water softener tank, which results in softened water that you can use throughout the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How Much Salt Does a Water Softener Use?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re treating hard water with a water softener, the amount of salt you use for the brine solution will be determined by the type of water softener system you have installed and how hard the water is that comes into your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Enercare, we can provide you with &lt;a href=&quot;/water-treatment&quot;&gt;water softening solutions&lt;/a&gt;, including water softeners rentals and water softener installation, and we can help you understand how salt plays a part in getting rid of hard water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you become a homeowner, you begin to learn about a variety of new things that you may have never even considered. Take the water you use in your home for example. Often times, home owners find the water they drink and wash with is considered hard water. Hard water is a term used to describe water that has a significant amount of magnesium and calcium. Hard water can make it difficult for detergent and soap to dissolve, as well as clog the water pipes and fixtures in your home. The solution to hard water is to install a water softener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is a Water Softener?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A water softener can be used to change the composition of the water in the home. With water softening, the ions in the water that make it hard are removed. In most cases, these are the ions associated with magnesium and calcium. When these ions are removed, you may notice that the water feels better and works well when washing clothes, dishes or even yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Issues with Hard Water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to install a water softening system in the home to deal with hard water. To begin, hard water can affect the plumbing of your home, clogging water pipes and fixtures. Soap will not dissolve as easily when washing your body and clothing may not wash properly. Limescale deposits can also take place in your water system. The limescale may cause your pipes to become blocked, which can lead to inefficiency with your water tanks or hot water boilers and lead to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/water-heating/water-heater-repair&quot;&gt;water heater repair call&lt;/a&gt; down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use a water softener, you can expand the life span of certain household equipment, such as a washing machine or hot water heater. You will also help you improve the longevity and quality of your water pumping system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How Does A Water Softener&amp;nbsp;Work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A water softener works by using specific ion exchangers that were created to remove ions that are positively charged from the water. Calcium and magnesium are the main components that are removed, as they are considered hard minerals. Softeners can also be used to remove iron. The softener will collect the minerals in the conditioning tank and then the minerals will eventually be flushed down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an ion exchanger type system is used, the water softener will replace the magnesium and calcium that has been removed with other ions such as potassium and sodium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installing a Water Softener&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a top-quality water softener installed in your home, it will last for many years. At Enercare, we specialize in water softener installations to help you remove the hard water in your home. We offer two solutions to choose from; one that will remove clear water iron or the combination water conditioning system that will soften water as well as remove chlorine.&lt;/p&gt;

Read more to make sure that you are as prepared as you can be for when the next storm hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Prepare your emergency kit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include winter-specific gear and replenish it each winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Make a communications plan with your family&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discuss how you will contact each other and what actions you’ll take in case of an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Stay connected to a radio or TV for alerts and warnings on hazardous conditions from Environment Canada&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download any available free smartphone apps. Organizations like the Canadian Red Cross can also provide information about finding shelters and how to receive first aid if you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Limit travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely have to travel, then be sure to keep an emergency kit in your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Bring pets and other animals inside&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure pets have access to fresh water as opposed to frozen water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Winterize your home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insulate walls and attics, caulk and weather strip doors and windows, and install storm windows or cover windows with plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Clean chimneys and other heating equipment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure they are inspected each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Insulate pipes with insulation or newspapers and plastic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a hard freeze is expected, allow faucets to drip a little to avoid solid freezing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Winterize your vehicle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure your antifreeze levels are good.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure your battery and ignition system are in top condition.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make sure your windshield wipers are working well.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use snow tires with adequate tread. In extreme cases of icy and snowy terrain, add chains or snow tires with studs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the level and weight of your oil. Heavier oils congeal more at low temperatures and don’t lubricate as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10. Bring extra layers of clothing and warm blankets if traveling by bus or car&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stranded you’ll have some protection from the cold. Pack an extra water bottle and some snacks, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every home is at risk for flooding during heavy rainfall periods. Although it is impossible to completely eliminate the possibility of a flood, there are preventative measures that can reduce the chances of a flood and ensure your home is protected in case one occurs. Consider these flood control fixes to help prevent stormwater runoff and flash floods from damaging your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Slope soil away from your home&amp;#39;s foundation, decks and porches.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look for holes or cracks in your foundation and completely seal these with vinyl concrete patching.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the downspouts around your home are sloped away from the foundation to allow water to drain away from your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Eavestroughs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the fall and spring, clean out eavestroughs and downspouts of any debris that might prevent proper drainage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Plug holes or cracks in your eavestroughs, downspouts, downspout extensions and seal these with silicon caulk.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Attach a few feet of extra downspout to the bottom of the downspout to ensure runoff is draining far away from your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Basement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you do not already have one, install a sump pump in your basement. A sump pump will act like a drain and prevent water from building up in the basement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not store valuables or important documents in the basement as this is the most common location in households for a flood.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure all furniture have legs so that in the case of a flood, furniture fabric will not accumulate or absorb any flood water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Sewer Line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider having a backwater valve (or backflow preventer) installed onto your home&amp;#39;s sewer line by a professional. In the event of a back-up, the valve automatically closes to prevent water and sewage from entering your home.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the backwater valve is properly installed to ensure sewage and water is stopped and not able to enter through other outlets in your basement, such as a sink, toilet or shower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how well you have maintained your system, your furnace might still be reaching the end of its lifespan. Here are some signs that your older equipment might need replacing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your energy bills are increasing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it might seem uneconomical to replace your equipment before it fails, a furnace replacement could actually save you money. Older, “conventional” burning furnaces and mid-efficient models were manufactured to operate at 60% to 80% efficiency, respectively, meaning about 20 to 40 cents of every dollar you spend heating your home goes right up the chimney. A new high efficiency furnace operates at well over 90 percent, meaning less than 10 cents is wasted. Inefficient furnaces use more energy, which might be one of the reasons your energy bills are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your furnace is the wrong size for your home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your home’s square footage, the age of the home, the number and location of windows and the number of people living in the home will all affect what size furnace your home needs. An older furnace might not be properly sized for your home. Improperly sized furnaces can make your home excessively dry, cause excess electrical and gas consumption and could possibly contribute to your furnace wearing out prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-advantage/furnace-rental&quot;&gt;Rent a high-efficiency furnace for as little as $49.50/month - view special offer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Equipment needs frequent repairs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;If you have a furnace repair company&lt;/a&gt; on speed dial, it might be worthwhile to invest in a new unit. Furnace repairs can be expensive and it might be more cost-effective to purchase a new furnace instead of feeding money into your old one. If you have an older unit, repairs are a temporary fix until your equipment inevitably breaks down for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some other signs that your furnace might need replacing:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your cooling or heating equipment seems less effective and some rooms won’t warm up or cool down&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your equipment runs for very short periods of time and comes on more frequently&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your furnace is very noisy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying to get one more year out of that old conventional or mid-efficiency&amp;nbsp;furnace before it breaks down, consider replacing it now to&amp;nbsp;enjoy the energy savings sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

Pros and Cons for 5 Types of Thermostats","1516404617","1620172346","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;With electricity rates increasing, homeowners are starting to pay closer attention to their energy use. It’s important to know how effectively your thermostat help you save energy because it acts as the control panel for your HVAC unit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help you better understand what kind of thermostat you need, let’s take a look at five common types of household thermostats and what the pros and cons of each are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Non-programmable Thermostats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-programmable thermostats are basic models that require you to change the temperature manually every time you think it’s too hot or too cold. Although they are easier to install and don’t have complex features, constantly adjusting the temperature can be inconvenient. This reactive approach may cause you to turn the thermostat higher than needed to warm up your home faster. This will likely result in more electricity use, minimizing any savings you think you may have made by keeping the thermostat lower in the first place. Most households are better off investing in a thermostat that yields higher energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mercury Thermostats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mercury thermostats are the most outdated type of non-programmable models and are usually only found in older homes. These thermostats are inexpensive, easy to install and straightforward to use, however, there are quite a few cons. Mercury thermostats require you to manually change the temperature to the desired comfort level, are the most inaccurate and inefficient of all models and are also considered a pollutant. Although mercury is safe for use in thermostats, it needs to be recycled properly to avoid health or environmental risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Programmable Thermostats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmable thermostats have a built-in time and date function that allows you to schedule the temperature of your home ahead of time. For example, you can program your thermostat to turn off during the hours you’re at work, and then turn back on shortly before you get home. Basic models have seven-day functions, while more advanced versions allow you to create multiple customized schedules, such as on/off times on weekends or various on/off times during a single day. Although programmable models are more expensive than non-programmable models, they have more potential for energy cost savings and provide priceless convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Smart Thermostats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A smart home thermostat learns your patterns and behaviours and will adjust your home’s temperature accordingly. You can input your postal code into the thermostat and it will regulate the temperature based on your outdoor weather conditions. If you use a &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-home-temperature-sensor&quot;&gt;smart temperature sensor&lt;/a&gt;, the thermostat can also account for the age, size and type of home you live in. After this data is captured, a smart thermostat will record the varying conditions in your home. For example, it can sense the lack of motion when nobody is home and change to “away mode.” A smart thermostat can also include a humidity sensor and remind you when to change your furnace filter. These models provide the most customized schedule temperatures to fit your family’s needs and reduce energy costs. However, they are more expensive and some people might find the bells and whistles too complicated to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wi-Fi Thermostats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some smart thermostats can operate on Wi-Fi. This provides the added convenience of checking your monthly usage report, monitoring your home’s comfort system and changing the temperature whenever you have access to a computer or smartphone. Some Wi-Fi thermostat models can alert you to sudden or unexpected drops or increases in temperatures and system malfunctions via a mobile app. The Wi-Fi option gives you complete control over your thermostat — even when you’re not home. Some people may find that this control brings a valuable peace of mind, while others may think of it as another app on their phones that they have to manage. &lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-smarter-home/smart-home-temperature-sensor&quot;&gt;Learn more about Wi-Fi thermostats&lt;/a&gt; to help you decide if they are right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between manual, programmable and smart thermostats, there are many models available to fit your family’s temperature needs. Think about your budget and lifestyle when choosing the right thermostat for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need help deciding which type of thermostat would work best with the furnace or air conditioner in your home, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact Enercare today&lt;/a&gt; to discuss your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this, in addition to having your &lt;a href=&quot;/heating/boiler&quot;&gt;boiler&lt;/a&gt; checked annually, we suggest paying attention to these telltale signs to make sure your boiler is operating properly and heating your home in a safe and efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs for homeowners to check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Age: With a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/protection-plans/boiler-protection-plan-plus&quot;&gt;proper maintenance and repair plan&lt;/a&gt;, a boiler should last approximately 15 years. You may need to consider having yours replaced if it is reaching that age.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increased energy bills: If you’re seeing a steady increase in your energy bills it could be a result of your aged boiler. Older models tend to be less energy efficient, so while investing in a new unit may cost you more in upfront, over time you’ll save more on your energy bills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comfort: Are certain rooms too cold or too hot? Varying temperatures could be a sign that something is wrong with your unit’s controls.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leakage: If your unit is leaking this could be a sign that your boiler is reaching the end of its lifespan. You may need to have it replaced in order to avoid a breakdown and possible flooding.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Discolouration: Check for black soot on your oil boilers or yellow flames on gas burners, which may indicate that the fuel is not burning properly. This is could also be a dangerous sign that the fuel is creating carbon monoxide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual cleaning from a professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Enercare, we offer our customers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/boiler-repair&quot;&gt;comprehensive 8-point boiler inspection&lt;/a&gt;. Not only do these checks and adjustments help prevent an unexpected boiler breakdown, they can also help reduce your monthly heating bills and keep your family safe by detecting carbon monoxide leaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enercare 8-point boiler check list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Test unit by putting it through a full operation cycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check unit is operating to manufacturer’s specifications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the heat exchanger for defects&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the water operating pressure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check primary and secondary pump&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check auto feed and backflow&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Safety test for carbon monoxide&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inspect the chimney flue for hazardous debris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of these checks indicate a concern, an Enercare technician will perform an additional 22-point safety check to help ensure that your equipment is operating properly. These checklists, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/boiler-maintenance&quot;&gt;regular boiler maintenance&lt;/a&gt;, help to detect hazardous carbon monoxide, prolong the lifespan of your equipment and reduce the hassle of unexpected breakdowns.&amp;nbsp;If a repair is needed, we'll provide a free, no surprises quote. However, Enercare customers with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/protection-plans/boiler-protection-plan &quot;&gt;boiler protection plan&lt;/a&gt; will have parts and labor totally covered.&lt;/p&gt;

"596","en","article","1","11","5 Tips to Make Your Furnace System More Efficient","1506622310","1620172487","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;With just a few simple steps, you can increase the efficiency of your heating system. Any system’s efficiency can be improved by: regularly changing filters, performing annual maintenance, repairing any issues quickly, buying a programmable thermostat and insulating your house to eliminate waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t spend a lot of time thinking about whether or not their furnace is functioning at peak performance. But the truth is that taking a few minutes here and there to ensure your furnace is running efficiently can help not only improve the performance of your furnace, but can also help consume less energy and lower your utility bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-maintenance&quot;&gt;Regular maintenance&lt;/a&gt; can have a big impact on the health of your furnace, particularly if you have an older system that hasn’t been maintained for a while. Giving your furnace a bit of an efficiency checkup doesn’t need to be complicated, so to help you out with your own system, here are a few simple and inexpensive tricks that could help you lower energy expenditure without lowering the output of your HVAC system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Change your filters every 90 days&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds so simple, but you wouldn’t believe how many homeowners fail to change their furnace filters on a regular basis. A change every 90 days can significantly boost furnace efficiency. Dirty filters add a lot of pressure to the furnace, which in turn forces the furnace to use more energy to pump hot air throughout the house. What’s more, furnaces can get clogged in a hurry when in heavy use, so during our Canadian winters, you might want to consider checking them every month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Close off all micro-leaks around doors and windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one doesn’t have anything to do with your furnace itself, but sealing off micro-leaks around your doors and windows can have a big impact on how much you need to use your furnace. Try inserting silicone gel into tiny creases located near your doors and windows to reduce the amount of wasted heat. No matter how small, those leaks can drain a lot of heat and force the HVAC system to work harder than it needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Install a programmable thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a digital thermostat that can decrease or increase the temperature based on your own programmed input can make a big difference on your monthly utility bill. These devices can turn the heat down at night or during times when no one is home, and up when your family would like it a little bit warmer. This will help ensure you’re not wasting energy keeping the house warm when no one’s home and you can still come home to a warm house without having to pay a fortune for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Take care of repairs without delay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to make sure that your HVAC system is in perfect order before continuing to use it. If you hear any unusual sounds or notice excessive moisture or dust around the house, you need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;schedule a repair session immediately.&lt;/a&gt; You never know how much internal damage your system is incurring by putting off those repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conduct annual checks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you think your HVAC system is working fine, you should still have a professional take a look at it once a year to ensure it stays that way. Professionals can spot problems early, before they become catastrophes, and can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/protection-plans/heating-protection-plan&quot;&gt;help you make simple repairs&lt;/a&gt; that will decrease the cost of maintenance and enable you to enter the winter months confident about furnace efficiency. Waiting for too long to call the technician might result in a serious breakdown, leaving your family in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/protection-plans &quot;&gt;Enercare offers HVAC protection plans&lt;/a&gt; to prepare our customers for the unexpected and eliminate future discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

"611","en","article","1","11","Why you need to check on your furnace before winter arrives","1491243089","1615586251","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;When your furnace is properly maintained, it is more likely to operate efficiently, be more economical, and be better for the health of you and your family throughout the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter is coming, and that means it’s time to check in on your furnace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, furnace maintenance isn’t one of those things we spend a lot of time thinking about, but to truly keep your furnace running at its best, you need to pay attention to the little things. But don’t worry, you can take over some of the simpler maintenance duties (i.e. changing the filter every 30 days in the winter) to keep the furnace at top performance, without calling in a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While furnace maintenance might seem like a demanding task, it can have a big impact on the proper operation and longevity of your HVAC system. When it comes to your furnace, a little bit of regular maintenance can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like any machine, a well-maintained furnace is more likely to perform better than one that is neglected. As they age, furnaces start using more and more energy, while also taking longer to achieve the desired temperature. There are multiple causes for this, and most of them can be alleviated with timely maintenance of the furnace. If you regularly fix or replace any failing parts, your furnace can remain healthy for up to 17 years, serving you faithfully through the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they get older, furnaces tend to collect and distribute particles of dust throughout your home, some of which you’re going to wind up inhaling. To help you and your family breathe a little easier, and a little cleaner, it’s important to have all of the leaks around your doors and windows sealed and your ducts cleaned to ensure the quality of air inside your home stays at a high level, even during those months of the year when you can open the window for some fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Finances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful management of your furnace is essential if you want to keep your expenses at a reasonable level. Regular furnace maintenance can help decrease your average energy bill, while also minimizing the chance that you will get whacked with costly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;emergency repairs&lt;/a&gt;. Many companies in Canada offer favorable protection plan options and heating maintenance plans designed to minimize the burden on the family budget, helping to ensure that most families can afford the appropriate technical care for their furnace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Peace of mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something you can’t put a price tag on. Awaiting a big storm with a furnace that is running at less than 100% efficiency can be a source of unnecessary stress that can be easily avoided. Heating is an essential need, and you can’t risk your family being stuck in freezing temperatures because of a minor technical failure. With a little bit of planning, you can help eliminate the possibility of problems with the furnace and enter the winter period without any lingering concerns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact Enercare today to learn how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-maintenance&quot;&gt;our furnace maintenance plans&lt;/a&gt; can make sure your furnace is inspected and maintained by certified professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Ductless air conditioning systems are increasing in popularity because of their size, function and flexible application. Learn more about ductless air conditioning systems below to see if this system might be an option for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Is Ductless Air Conditioning?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, a ductless air conditioner is a premium unit that does not sit in your window or plug into a wall outlet. The system is hung on the wall but is wired just like a central air conditioning system. It can easily be placed in the home without the need for ductwork. This cuts down on your installation cost as there is no need to install bulky ductwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of a Ductless System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits to using a ductless air conditioning system. &amp;nbsp;You will use less energy to cool the home, potentially lowering your monthly utility bill. This method of cooling the home is good for those who want to stick to a budget and still enjoy a comfortable home. Another benefit of a ductless air conditioning system is that it works well as a cooling source for homes that have a boiler system (meaning there is no existing ductwork in the home). Not only can a ductless system provide cooling comfort, but most units today can also provide secondary heating in the winter, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are adding additional space to the home or have an area that won’t heat or cool the way you want. Consider installing a ductless system into the new space or instead of paying to replace or improve existing ductwork (or having to upgrade your equipment). The cost would likely be lower and you would be able to enjoy the same great cooling comfort in these areas in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Learn More About Ductless Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn more about a ductless cooling system is to speak to an HVAC professional. At Enercare, you will find our very knowledgeable Energy Management Consultants can describe in detail an example of a ductless air conditioning system and explain how and where the air conditioning system would be installed in your home and how it will operate. This will give you a much better idea as to how the system can be incorporated into your home if you're considering buying or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/enercare-advantage/air-conditioner-rental#blog&quot;&gt;renting a new air conditioning system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"626","en","article","1","11","Manual, Programmable or Smart Thermostats: Which is the Best for Your Home?","1491243052","1620158168","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;There are many types of thermostats available in the market, including manual dial-based, programmable thermostats, and smart thermostats, each providing different benefits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The thermostat is an integral part of the heating system, tasked with keeping the temperature in the house at a level set by the homeowner. The furnace will automatically turn off when this temperature is reached, helping to reduce the consumption of energy and avoid unwanted overheating. The thermostat also impacts the overall energy bills, as it can help save on heating costs during the winter. It’s important for you to review and carefully consider each option before installing a thermostat in your home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s run through the most important advantages of each type of thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Manual thermostats: Control at your fingertips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many homes in Canada are still well-served by mercury-based thermostats that feature a manual dial. To change the desired temperature, you can simply turn it to the appropriate notch. While generally effective for simple heat management, these thermostats can be imprecise and inconvenient to use, which is why switching to a more advanced model may be a good idea that could result in significant savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Programmable thermostats: No need for reminders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital programmable thermostat can regulate the heat production in your home based on a predetermined schedule. For example, these thermostats can be instructed to cool down the house a bit when nobody is there to ensure heat isn’t wasted on an empty home, or to start warming it up one hour before everyone gets up on a cool winter morning. Programmable thermostats are more efficient than a manual thermostat, however the range of options offered can be limiting for some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Smart thermostats: Monitoring your environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in maximum control over the temperature of your home, you could consider investing in a smart thermostat. This electronic device is initially fed with information about your home and its geographic location, which allows it to calculate the weather patterns and determine your heating needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to choose the right type?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading your thermostat is a great way to maximize your furnace efficiency that can result in a reduction in your heating bills, so you should think about this move if you still own a manual or older programmable model.

&lt;p&gt;A furnace system is a common unit installed in the home to provide heating comfort. Homeowners use their furnace during the winter months to be able to enjoy a comfortable home when the temperatures outdoors are cold. Because a furnace system is an integral part of the home, it must be properly maintained. There are maintenance steps you can implement yourself as well as with help from an HVAC professional. Check out a few maintenance tips below to keep your furnace in top condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Carefully Maintain?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, you may be wondering why your furnace needs to be maintained so carefully. A furnace that is improperly maintained can break down and cost you money in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;repairs&lt;/a&gt; as well as time spent in a cold home. With regular professional maintenance, your system will be checked for any potential problems by having each component reviewed. Not only will your unit be in excellent shape, but you can help avoid any issues to the family such as carbon monoxide leaks, which can sometimes happen with a faulty furnace system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changing out the Filter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A maintenance step you can take care of yourself is changing out the filter. Before you begin heating your home, be sure to check the filter and replace as needed. A fresh filter helps the unit to function properly, pushing clean heat through your home. When a filter is not changed and a system runs with a dirty filter, it can affect the performance of the furnace. The system needs to be able to push air without delay and a clogged filter will put extra strain on the heating system which can result in a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Staying Safe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a furnace system can be at risk for carbon monoxide leaks, it is essential that you have a carbon monoxide monitor in the area near your furnace. A carbon monoxide monitor is similar to a smoke alarm. If the unit detects carbon monoxide, an alarm will sound. Be sure to check the alarm and add fresh batteries as needed to be sure that your family will be protected if a leak were to occur. A good time to check your unit is at the same time as Daylight Savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Professional Maintenance Check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can take care of many aspects of maintenance in your home, it is recommended that your furnace be inspected by a professional before the furnace operating season. This will ensure that your furnace is operating effectively and can provide quality heat in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your system will be checked in a number of ways to ensure each component is functioning as it should be. This will include operating pressures, condensation system, air handler temperatures, safety testing for carbon monoxide, inspecting the chimney flue, fan belt check and performance, and other maintenance tasks. Every aspect of your unit is inspected to ensure that the system is functioning properly. You will be able to rest easy in a comfortably heated home knowing that your furnace is operating at peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;

"636","en","article","1","11","Replacing your furnace: When is the right time?","1491243052","1615586213","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Older heating systems are prone to breakdowns, often require more fuel and electricity to run, and can be unreliable. But how do you know when it’s time to take the plunge and invest in a new furnace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, most people don’t look forward to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/new-furnace&quot;&gt;buying a new furnace&lt;/a&gt;, and even then, only when it’s absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, upgrading to a new furnace might not be a decision worth delaying. That’s because in some cases, it’s smarter and more economical to upgrade your heating system that is still functional, than to wait for the moment when your furnace finally stops working to look for a replacement. If your heating system has been in regular use for more than 10 to 15 years, it’s easy for small problems to pile up and hamper the proper functioning of your furnace. Here are a few sensible arguments that could motivate you to make an investment into a new furnace, sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Better to err on the side of caution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older furnaces that have experienced heavy use can be notoriously unreliable and could stop working in the middle of winter without any warning. Every year you delay replacing your furnace may add a bit more risk. Regular scheduled maintenance is essential to avoiding a breakdown at the most inconvenient time, but it is always better to be prepared and without this regular maintenance you may end up spending more money in the process. A professional furnace technician can spare you the headaches and allow you to enter the cold season with a new high-efficiency furnace for complete peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cutting energy expenditure and repair costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be an expert to know that poorly maintained furnaces burn more energy and break down more frequently than newer and well-maintained models. By putting off a large expenditure for too long, you could rack up a lot of bills on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/furnace-repair#blog&quot;&gt;furnace repair&lt;/a&gt; without any long-term benefit to show for it. Instead of bleeding cash every winter, you are probably better off opening your wallet now and getting a modern, high-performance furnace installation that should only require regular maintenance&amp;nbsp;will help keep your house warm day and night. It’s a bit of short term pain for long term gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Taking advantage of seasonal discounts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the fall, many companies try to expand their customer base by offering great deals on heating systems. Take advantage of these promotions to help you to shave down some of the cost of a new furnace. That way, you can upgrade your home and achieve long term savings at the same time, especially if your timing is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air conditioning is essential to the home for a number of reasons, including comfort. In the summer months, temperatures rise, leaving us sweating and feeling miserable in our homes if the air conditioner isn’t working well or the home doesn’t have one. &amp;nbsp;Thankfully, we have the ability to install quality air conditioning units in the home to provide the comfort we need to keep cool in the summer heat. For many homeowners, the air conditioning system of the home may need to be replaced or maintained in order to provide quality comfort. A simple way to assess your comfort is how you feel at night. Do you find that you get hot once you hit the sheets? If so, it might be time to have your air conditioner looked at by an experienced technician or a new unit installed in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Importance of Cooling Comfort and Sleep&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep and staying cool go hand in hand, especially during the summer months. One can be completely miserable if the temperatures continue to rise and the air conditioning system cannot keep up, especially at night when trying to sleep. When going to bed, you want to be comfortable and not feel sticky or sweaty. When you get too hot, you may have difficulty sleeping. Staying cool actually helps to regulate your sleep. If you find that you are not staying cool and are constantly tossing and turning due to too much heat in your home, it’s time to have your air conditioning system evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;A New Air Conditioning Unit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An air conditioning system has an average life span of 10 to 20 years, depending on the unit type and how well the system is maintained. If you care for a unit with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling/ac-maintenance#blog&quot;&gt;proper maintenance and check-ups&lt;/a&gt;, then you can use the same system year after year, keeping your home cool in the hot summer months. However, once a unit reaches a certain age, it may not have the ability to cool the home like it did in the past. Over time, an air conditioning system loses its energy efficiency and can no longer keep up with rising temperatures. A new air conditioner can easily provide cooling comfort, with less energy used in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have your existing air conditioning system evaluated by the experts to see just how your system is functioning. Recommendations can be made as to what unit type will work best in your home and an estimate provided by the technician inspecting the system. Once you make a decision on a new unit, you will find that your home is cooler and you are spending less money each month to stay comfortable. Be sure and schedule regular maintenance for your new unit so that it will stay in top condition year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

Find out how to do it in a more environmentally-sensitive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Consider which items are worth the move&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inventory each item you&amp;#39;re packing and determine if you really need it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hold a garage sale or donate unwanted items to charity instead of throwing them away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Seek out green moving materials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ask a restaurant or retail store for cardboard boxes for your move.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Buy used cardboard boxes or locate them from other movers on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecycle.org/&quot;&gt;freecycle.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid cardboard boxes altogether - rent reusable packing crates instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Opt for green packing materials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose materials like recycled newspaper instead of using bubble wrap.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use old towels or clothes - pack and protect your items at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Check the trucks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look for environmentally-friendly movers in your area.&lt;/li&gt;

Homeowners are alerted via the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app in real time when the contact sensor&amp;nbsp;detects that the door or window has been opened. The contact sensor can also be placed on gates, cabinets or closed doors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to enable Smarter Home Door and Window Contact Sensor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the home screen on the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app and Enercare Smarter Home Portal, select the tile called 'Sensors' by clicking on the right arrow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare Smarter Home Door and Window Contact Sensor&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;8a425217-ecf0-4f1d-85e7-1644958d9747&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/image1_kat.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the Sensor page which has three sub tabs, 'Device', 'Notification' and 'Rules'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) &lt;strong&gt;Device Tab&lt;/strong&gt;: The device tab lists every contact sensor in the home. Each contact sensor is listed in a row where users can view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Name of the sensor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Status of the sensor; either open, closed or activated&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Type of sensor; either a door/window contact sensor or a motion detector&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Activity Monitoring: Users can check if the contact sensor is enabled. By checking the box, users will see when a specific contact sensor is open or closed, even when the system is not armed. This information is shown in the system status and event history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) Notification Tab: Notifications let users know a contact sensor is activated. All active notifications are listed in this tab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Whether for Halloween trick or treaters or if you're expecting a lot of guests in one day, you can temporarily disable these feature so you don't receive notifications from your Enercare Smarter Home Video Doorbell. This option also helps to temporarily&amp;nbsp;minimize the amount of video saves, so your allotted 1000 per month is not affected by every visitor that rings your doorbell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here's an easy way to disable the motion detection and video recording feature from the Enercare Smarter Home moble app:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home mobile app&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the menu, select 'Video' and click the gear icon located at the top right corner of the screen&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare Smarter Home App Menu&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;960843df-45be-4cc6-bb47-3edbb04a7d79&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/app_menu_sh.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Select 'Pause/Resume Recording Schedules'&amp;nbsp;and select the toggle switch to deactivate 'Doorbell motion' and the 'Doorbell Call' feature&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare Smarter Home Video Menu&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;37613957-7b5f-48d9-aea8-f78190a8d1d1&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/pause.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A small pop-up at the bottom of the screen will confirm your doorbell motion schedule has been turned off&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare Smarter Home Schedule Turn Off Notification&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;784a7148-68a8-4007-8bc6-afa70674ab03&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/scheduleoffnotification.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Now that the motion detection feature and call feature is disabled, the Enercare Smarter Home Video Doorbell will not send a&amp;nbsp;notification&amp;nbsp;when the doorbell is pushed&amp;nbsp;or record video when motion is detected at your front door.&amp;nbsp; When you are ready to reactivate these features, simply reselect the toggle switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here's how to disable the motion detection and video recording feature from the Enercare Smarter Home Portal:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the account homepage, select 'Video' located in the left side panel&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare Smarter Home Video Menu&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;e6ed6fe5-7117-4562-a25b-0d73776bd227&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/videomenu.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click 'Recording Rules' at the top of the page&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare Smarter Home Recording Rules Menu&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;6d888038-640f-467b-8187-3db8dc1b52eb&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/recording_rules_0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Next to 'Doorbell Motion Recording', select the blue toggle switch. It will then turn grey to indicate that your recordings are now disabled&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now your motion recording feature is disabled for your Enercare Smarter Home Video Doorbell. This means you will no longer receive notifications for motion recordings detected from your doorbell camera. Don't forget to reenable these features by reselecting the toggle switch. Once it turns blue again, you are ready to save and receive notifications when the doorbell is pushed&amp;nbsp;or record video when motion is detected at your front door&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Check-in at home with live streaming video from anywhere in the world using your smartphone, tablet, or computer. You can view the inside and outside of your home from the same screen and view multiple locations at once, which comes in handy if you have a vacation home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customize your video settings to capture only the things you care about, record clips during certain hours of the day or use geo-fencing to record footage while you're away from home. Every clip is saved to the cloud, where you have an available storage of 1000 videos. When you have used 100% of your storage allowance, the oldest clip will be removed to make room for new clips as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To view your upload limit:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click on the arrow at the top right of the 'Live Video' card.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the page, click 'Saved Video Clips'&amp;nbsp;to access your saved clips stored on the cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A pop-up page will appear with details about your current saved video usage. Our notifications will let you know when you have reached 50% and&amp;nbsp;90% of your upload limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to download videos from the cloud:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have used 100% of the allocated storage limit of 1000 video clips, the oldest unprotected clip&amp;nbsp;will be removed to make room for new clips as they come in. Not to worry, you can choose to download as many video clips as you would like on to your hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the dashboard, click on the arrow at the top right of the 'Live Video'&amp;nbsp;card.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the page, select 'Saved Video Clips'&amp;nbsp;to access the clips stored on the cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the list of saved videos, select the video you wish to download and click 'Select'.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the page, select the download icon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A pop-up page will appear with download options. You can choose to save the video in three available formats: Windows Video File (AVI), Mac Video File (MOV) or Mobile Video File (MP4). Select the format you wish to save your file as and click 'Save'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Your video will begin to download and will be saved on to your hard drive for you to easily access. You can download as many video clips as you'd like onto your hard drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to delete videos from the cloud:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the dashboard, click on the arrow at the top right of the 'Live Video' card.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the page, select 'Saved Video Clips'&amp;nbsp;to access the clips stored on the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the displayed list of saved videos, select the video you wish to delete and click 'Select'. You can select multiple video clips at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the page, select the trash can icon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A pop-up page will appear, asking you to confirm the selected clip you wish to delete. Click 'Delete Clips' to confirm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect video clips from being written over in the cloud:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have reached your video storage limit of 1000 on the cloud, any additional clip saved to the cloud will remove the oldest unprotected clip to make room for the new clip. If you do not wish to download the data on to your hard drive, you will lose the video content as it gets replaced. Another option is to 'protect' certain clips to ensure they will not be deleted when you go over your allotted limit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Log into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alarm.com/CAN/Enercare?home=1&quot;&gt;Enercare Smarter Home Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Click the arrow at the top right of the 'Live Video' card.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the page, select 'Saved Video Clips' to access the clips stored on the cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From the list of saved videos, select the video you wish to protect and click 'Select'. You can select multiple video clips at a time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the top of the page, select the lock icon.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The selected clip is now protected and will not be deleted when another clip is saved on the cloud.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To better organize saved clips, you can choose to rename the file by selecting the pencil icon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the space provided, enter the new description and click 'Save'. Your new video description will be displayed under 'Saved Video Clips'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Trotter, a veteran Enercare technician in Southern Ontario has serviced hundreds of boilers throughout his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you have a boiler, it needs to be serviced regularly, just like your car,” said John Trotter. “Even the best boilers will eventually wear out and need replacing, but regular maintenance will likely increase the lifespan of the boiler.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be difficult for homeowners to determine when a boiler needs to be replaced but there are some signs to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Boiler&quot; data-caption=&quot;Enercare Residential Boiler System&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;58b84b80-ec44-444c-a29b-e36a379f963a&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/boiler.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most obvious sign that something is going wrong with a boiler is some or all of the rooms in your home no longer feel comfortable. You are finding it difficult to get a room at the right warmth or coolness. If temperature control is an on-going issue, considered having a trained expert in to inspect the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know how old your boiler is that will give you some indication as to whether it is getting close to having to be replaced. The best boilers have a lengthy life span, but they too will eventually fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of boiler will also be a factor in how long it will last. Cast iron boilers have a reputation for lasting many years while other types will usually average at least 15 years. If you are not sure of the age of the boiler you may want to have a qualified professional assess it. This expert can tell you the approximate age of the boiler, what condition it is in and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/boiler-maintenance&quot;&gt;perform any required maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Increases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another warning sign that you may be running into boiler problems is when you see an unexpected increase in your energy bills. This may mean your boiler is no longer functioning efficiently. Also, take note of how often you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/boiler-repair&quot;&gt;get your boiler serviced&lt;/a&gt;. This may be another sign that the boiler is reaching the end of its lifespan and no longer functioning properly, and replacement might be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Boiler Signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may notice that black soot is beginning to build up on the burners, or you may see the gas burner flames are yellow. What this could indicate that the boiler is creating carbon monoxide because the fuel is not burning properly. This can be potentially dangerous and is a definite indicator that you need to call in your boiler service expert immediately or inform your gas company.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don’t already have a dependable heating system in place and are considering investing in a one, a boiler is a great option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of heating system circulates hot water, or steam, through your home’s heat distribution system. The hot water or steam is carried through a series of pipes and into a radiator to create heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;Boiler&quot; data-caption=&quot;Enercare Residential Boiler System&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;58b84b80-ec44-444c-a29b-e36a379f963a&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/boiler.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years boiler systems have seen many technical advancements when it comes to design, individual components and overall construction of the units. In particular, the changeover to condensing boiler systems has proven more efficient than previous designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When purchasing a boiler, check to see if it’s earned an ENERGY STAR® certification, which indicates that the boiler meets certain energy efficiency guidelines. Selecting energy efficient heating and cooling equipment helps you save money on utility bills and helps protect the climate by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still not convinced? Here are a few other reasons to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/enercare-advantage/boiler-rental&quot;&gt;upgrading to a new boiler&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased efficiency: Boilers lose very little of the heat they generate as heat doesn’t need to pass through your ducts. This can save you money on your energy bills and reduce your overall energy consumption.&lt;br /&gt;
Radiant Heating: Boilers can be used in combination with radiant heat. Radiant heat systems provide warmth directly to the floor panels to keep everything in the room warm, including your feet.&lt;br /&gt;
Combination Boiler: A combination boiler system can provide domestic hot water and home heating in a single, compact unit. These systems are cost-effective and energy-efficient.&lt;br /&gt;
Noise: Another bonus is that boilers are silent. If you hear gurgling or other noises in your pipes, that’s a sign you need your system should be inspected.&lt;br /&gt;
Snow Melt Systems: If you’re not a fan of shovelling snow, you can even run the tubing under your driveway and walkways.&lt;br /&gt;
Reduces allergens: People with allergies often prefer radiant heating as it doesn’t distribute allergens in the same manner as forced air systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the best system to meet your home’s heating needs, chat with one of our Energy Management Consultants. We have the expertise to install and service a wide range of heating boilers and hydronic boiler systems. We can also provide further information on upgrading to a high-efficiency model and government incentives that may be available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Pursue ENERGY STAR&amp;reg; options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replace outdated appliances or electronics with ENERGY STAR&amp;reg;&amp;nbsp;models and start saving.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Switch your light bulbs with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.energystar.gov/products/lighting_fans/light_bulbs&quot;&gt;ENERGY STAR&amp;reg;&amp;nbsp;bulbs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and save up to $30 - $80 over the lifetime of each bulb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Create less waste&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Buy a durable water bottle to refill instead of plastic bottled water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use inexpensive tote bags for shopping instead of plastic bags that will be thrown away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Manage light usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off the lights when a room is not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open the curtains to welcome sunlight during the day.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Try to go as long as possible in the evening before finally turning the lights on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Embrace cooler water&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set your water heater to between 43℃ (110℉) to 49℃ (120℉).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use cold water rather than hot when doing laundry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Eliminate useless energy waste&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Look for leaky faucets that need to be fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unplug electronics and chargers when not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shut off computers completely instead of using sleep mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Find alternatives to throwing away&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before throwing anything away, see if you can recycle, donate or even sell it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Re-purpose if you can (for example, turning a jar into a flower pot or a tire into a swing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Choose cloth over paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use cloth towels for cleaning, cloth napkins at meals, and cloth diapers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Repurpose old t-shirts as cleaning rags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Smarter Home Video solution keeps your eye on the things that matter so you know what is happening - directly from your phone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Smarter Home automation, you can customize your video settings to capture only the things you care about. Set rules to only record clips during certain hours of the day, restrict recordings to certain areas or use geo-fencing to capture footage when you are away from your home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to set up your video recordings:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During cold winters, your heating system can make the air in your home dry, making it uncomfortable for you and your family. Maintaining proper indoor air quality during the winter months is important for your comfort and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dry and cold air combined with a running furnace&amp;nbsp;can reduce the amount of moisture in the home. To improve the air quality, you can add stand-alone humidifiers to those areas where you spend the most time, or you can install a whole house humidifier to your heating system to maintain proper moisture levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways that a humidifier can be good for your health and your home according to Dave Walton, Director of Home Ideas at Enercare Home Services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A humidifier can help the body’s immune system guard against irritants, keeping your family healthy. Dry air can be the cause of various illnesses and respiratory conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When the air is dry, static electricity is often the cause of frizzy hair, static cling, shocks from touching metal objects and even nosebleeds. Increasing the home’s humidity level can help reduce these nuisances.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Maintaining proper humidity can prevent your hardwood floors, wood moulding and furniture from shrinking and cracking.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Using a humidifier helps to keep the home feel more comfortable and may allow you to turn the thermostat down one or two degrees which can potentially lower your heating bills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping the correct humidity level in your home is important. Humidity levels below 20% are associated with increased discomfort, static electricity and dry skin1.&amp;nbsp;High humidity levels can result in condensation within the home and on interior surfaces such as windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave recommends that the average relative humidity level be between 20%-40%1.&amp;nbsp;This range will provide the best comfort for your family, while protecting wooden furniture, floors and many belongings and materials in your home. To measure the relative humidity in your home, you can purchase a hygrometer from most home improvement stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

"1046","en","article","1","46"," Why should I use green energy in my home?","1516742904","1568666018","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to be green, but the biggest are economical and environmental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The economic benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Green energy relies more on manpower than machines, which translates into more jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Because green energy is created domestically, we are less dependent on foreign energy sources.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As the green energy movement has grown, energy prices have become more stable and continue to drop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The environmental benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The production of non-green electricity is often the largest source of industrial air pollution.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Renewable energy sources do not pollute the air with CO2 emissions like fossil fuel extraction does.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clean air means health benefits for everyone. Air pollution is commonly linked to breathing problems, neurological damage, and even heart attacks or cancer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Get your house ready&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unplug or power down non-essential appliances before your departure, including electronics like the TV, computer or stereo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Pack efficiently&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pack only what you need - extra items mean extra weight, and reduced fuel efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lighter bags are easier to carry and less expensive to transport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Reduce car use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use public transportation to and from the airport and to sites near your destination.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do a ride share with a program like Uber.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explore local sites on foot.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Rent a smaller, more fuel-efficient car, when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Go paperless when possible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose the airline&amp;rsquo;s ticketless options to reduce paper and improve check in times.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Opt for paperless check&amp;nbsp;in options at hotels if available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Fly green&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fly direct. It protects you against luggage loss, saves time and reduces emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Treat your hotel room like home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off lights when they are not in use and use the air conditioner less.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Opt against daily towel and linen service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Shop smart for souvenirs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Buy eco-friendly souvenirs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose smaller, lighter items that minimize the added luggage weight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Choose items that are locally made or made from re-usable materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

"1086","en","article","1","11","10 green living tips","1516749150","1568666385","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Being a friend to the environment doesn&amp;#39;t have to be difficult. Here are ten easy was to be greener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Install motion sensors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching to motion-sensor lights that illuminate in response to movement can reduce outdoor energy expenses by as much as 30%, compared to leaving the lights on at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Sweep driveways, patios and walkways &amp;ndash; with a broom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t waste water washing dirt and debris off these areas &amp;ndash; a broom is just as efficient and doesn&amp;rsquo;t waste water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Apply natural fertilizers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-natural fertilizers reduce the environmental impact, making them worth the additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Use solar lights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illuminate a garden, flag, or other focal point in the yard, use solar-powered lights that charge all day and run on solar energy to provide light at night, reducing the need for additional electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Plant trees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planting a tree does more than improve the aesthetic appeal of a neighbourhood. It also cleans the air by absorbing carbon dioxide. Local nurseries can help homeowners find trees for any space, and many cities offer rebate incentives for purchasing and planting trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Mix up what you plant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planting one type of plant in your garden or landscaping may draw pests that are attracted to its offerings. But if you plant a variety, this may&amp;nbsp;push pests to go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Leave grass clipping where they lay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raking up grass clippings denies the lawn an important natural fertilizer. As grass clippings decompose, their nutrients go back into the soil. Leaving the grass clippings to fertilize the lawn also prevents them from being added to the waste at a landfill site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Conserve water in your plantings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce the amount of water spent on fresh plantings, plant smart. Start by planting native species that are used to the amount of rain your area typically receives. This will help to prevent additional required watering. Apply composite to the soil to retain moisture as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Avoid pressure-treated wood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressure-treated wood, though a cheaper option, is bad for the environment. The chemicals that &amp;lsquo;treat&amp;rsquo; the wood will slowly enter the atmosphere as the structure ages, harming the environment as well as those who breathe in the chemicals. Untreated wood options may be slightly more expensive, but the health and environmental benefits outweigh the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10. Don&amp;rsquo;t water at mid-day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeowners who must water their grass should avoid doing so during the sun&amp;rsquo;s peak hours as the heat will burn the water off before it has a chance to nourish the lawn. Instead, water in the early morning or evening when the sun is not at its height. This will reduce water waste and nourish the grass as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Adjust the temperature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set your thermostat to 20°C (68°F) or lower in winter and 25.6°C (78°F) or higher in summer to use less energy. Adjusting the temperature further during the night will save even more money.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Natural sunlight also helps your home’s energy efficiency. Open curtains to let in sunlight during the winter and close curtains to keep it out in the summer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Set your water heater to between 43°C (110°F) to 49°C (120°F).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Unplug electronics when not in use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unplug rarely used appliances like basement or garage refrigerators when not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unplug chargers for phones, tablets, and digital cameras when not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off power strips when not in use. Even the standby mode can use as much energy as a 75 or 100 watt bulb run consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Think energy efficiency when using appliances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the seals on the refrigerator door to ensure it is tightly sealed and secure. Keep the door closed as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clean the lint filter in the dryer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Only run the dishwasher and washing machine with a full load.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Invest in ENERGY STAR® appliances when it is time to purchase new appliances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Appliance tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure your fridge temperature is set correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Limit the number of times you open the refrigerator door - warm air gets in.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep your fridge well stocked - it’s more energy efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the seals on your refrigerator door. Faulty seals let cool air escape and cause your fridge to run inefficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dry your dishes by hand or let them air dry. Your dishwasher's drying cycle consumes a lot of energy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replace your old, inefficient appliances with new, efficient, ENERGY STAR®&amp;nbsp;appliances. Older appliances will still run inefficiently, even if you follow all of these tips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cooking tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use the right pot for the job - don't heat empty space.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use as few burners as possible. One burner instead of two cuts your energy usage in half.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn down the burner once your water is boiling. You don't need to keep it on high to maintain that boil.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open the oven door as little as possible - warm air gets out, jeopardizing your oven's energy efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Seal all leaks around doors, windows, and electrical outlets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save up to 20% on your heating bill. Cost of materials is typically under $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Install foam gaskets behind your electrical outlets, light switches and lighting fixtures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or use plastic security caps to reduce heat loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Clean the chimney and get vent systems checked&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pipes must be properly connected and there should be no signs of rust or damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Clean your heating vents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure they aren't blocked by furniture or drapes and that the vents are open. Vacuum out dust and pet hair from the warm air registers and the cold air returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Remove window air conditioners for the winter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they must stay in place, seal them with caulking or tape and cover them with an airtight, insulated jacket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Check your water heater&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If its surface is hot or even warm, some of the energy used to heat the water is being wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Set your water heater thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your water heater thermostat should be between 43°C (110°F) and 49°C (120°F).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Upgrade your insulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a minimal cost, you can upgrade the insulation in your exterior walls, crawl spaces, basements and attics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Get rid of single-pane windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add storms to cut heat loss by up to 50%. Better still, replace single-pane windows with energy efficient double-pane windows with inert argon gas fill, warm-edge spacers and low-e coating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10. Replace your old furnace with a more energy efficient one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/heating/new-furnace&quot;&gt;Upgrading&amp;nbsp;your furnace&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to an ENERGY STAR®&amp;nbsp;model can save up to 30% on your heating costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Plant a shade tree&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block the sunlight from coming through the windows to reduce the energy needed to cool your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Use hand tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conserve energy and benefit from exercise by replacing weed whackers with clippers, leaf blowers with rakes, and riding lawnmowers with push mowers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Seek alternative modes of transportation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave the car at home for short trips. Walk or ride a bike instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Compost for garden use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a compost pile for rich, environmentally-friendly fertilizer and reduce the need to run the garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Research lighting options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose energy-saving alternatives like solar yard lights, motion sensor lights and ENERGY STAR®&amp;nbsp;bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving appliances and electronic devices plugged in will drain a significant amount of energy, even if they are not in use and the power is turned off. This is called &amp;ldquo;phantom&amp;rdquo; power, and it accounts for up to 10% of your household energy use and can cost you approximately $150 a year in electricity1. This ghost power is sucking money from your wallets and energy from power grids. &amp;nbsp;Here are five easy ways that you can fight the phantoms and avoid unnecessary costs on your next energy bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Unplug those chargers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your computer, phone and other devices have finished charging, make it a habit to unplug the chargers. Consider creating a charging station using a power bar with multiple outlets, making it easier to switch off the entire strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Install timers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plug household devices into a power bar with a &amp;ldquo;smart strip&amp;rdquo; or timer that shuts off power while you are sleeping or at work. Timers allow you to manually set on and off times, while &amp;ldquo;smart strips&amp;rdquo; detect changes in electricity currents, automatically powering on and off devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Group appliances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plugging bundled devices into the same power bar will make shutting off the appliances or electronics commonly used together much easier. Think &amp;ldquo;computer, monitor and printer&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;toaster and coffee maker&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Disconnect idle clocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might need an alarm clock every morning, but consider unplugging those in spare bedrooms. Clocks are especially energy draining as they require constant power, so leave them unplugged until you have guests visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Look for the ENERGY STAR&amp;reg;&amp;nbsp;label&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you are shopping for new appliances or electronics, look for products certified with the ENERGY STAR&amp;reg;label. These products are more energy efficient and typically have power saving features, even in standby mode.&lt;/p&gt;

"1281","en","article","1","11","5 tips for an energy efficient living room","1516743526","1593730065","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;The living room is one of the most popular rooms in your home. Read these tips to make it even better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Make your lighting energy efficient&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace traditional light bulbs with energy-efficient lighting and use ENERGY STAR®&amp;nbsp;light fixtures. Turn off the lights when you leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Install a power strip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save energy by attaching your electronic equipment to a single power strip and turning it off when you're finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Install energy efficient electronics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose ENERGY STAR® options when buying your new TV, DVD player or home theatre system to save money and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Adjust your thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save money on your monthly cooling and heating bill by setting your thermostat to 20°C (68°F) in the winter and 25.6°C (78°F) in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Protect air from escaping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close your fireplace flue damper to prevent warm or cool air from escaping up the chimney. Use insulated drapes to block out the sun in the summer and keep warm air inside in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Heating tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Put on a sweater and lower your thermostat by 2&amp;deg;C (4&amp;deg;F).&amp;nbsp;Save as much as 4% on your heating bill.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Throw down a rug.&amp;nbsp;You&amp;#39;ll help insulate your floors, and cut down on the noise too.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Program your thermostat.&amp;nbsp;A lower temperature at night and after you leave for work can save up to 10% on your heating bill. Don&amp;#39;t reduce the temperature more than 3 - 4&amp;deg;C (6 - 8&amp;deg;F).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check your furnace filter monthly and replace if dirty.&amp;nbsp;A properly maintained furnace reduces energy consumption and could save up to 5% on your heating costs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install a furnace filter alarm on your furnace.&amp;nbsp;It will make a whistling sound when it is time to change your filters.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check supply and return air vents.&amp;nbsp;Make sure they are not blocked by furniture, drapes and appliances.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install a heat recovery ventilator.&amp;nbsp;It improves indoor air quality by expelling stale indoor air and uses its heat to pre-heat the incoming fresh air.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open the drapes or blinds on sunny days.&amp;nbsp;South-facing windows provide free heat. Remember to close the drapes or blinds when the sun sets.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add a humidifier to your heating system.&amp;nbsp;The humidity may allow you to turn down your thermostat and still be comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t crank up the heat.&amp;nbsp;The house will warm up at the same rate, regardless of the temperature setting.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t heat uninsulated&amp;nbsp;areas.&amp;nbsp;Typically, garages, crawl spaces, attics and storage sheds do not need to be heated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Furnace maintenance saves energy.&amp;nbsp;A tune-up can save 3 - 10% on your next heating bill. Clean or replace your furnace filters regularly for even more savings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Fireplace tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Split wood into pieces that are 10 - 15cm (4 - 6&amp;quot;) in diameter.&amp;nbsp;The wood will burn more cleanly with more surface area exposed to the flame.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install a fireplace thermostat.&amp;nbsp;It will help you control your room temperature.
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Damper tips:&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Close the damper when the fireplace is not in use.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Check that the seal on the flue damper is as snug as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Consider installing tempered glass doors and a heat-air exchange system that blows warm air into the room.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Reduce heat loss by opening dampers in the bottom of the firebox (if provided) or open the nearest window slightly and close the doors into the room.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;Lower your thermostat setting to between 10&amp;deg; - 13&amp;deg;C (50&amp;deg;F - 55&amp;deg;F).&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t use your fireplace when the outside temperature is below -7&amp;deg;C (19&amp;deg;F). The cold air coming into your house through the open flue wastes more heat than is gained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Insulation tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check your attic insulation.&amp;nbsp;If there is less than R-22 (7&amp;rdquo; of fibreglass or rock wool or 6&amp;rdquo; of cellulose) you could benefit by adding more.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consider installing roof vents and inlets&amp;nbsp;to improve ventilation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Put clear plastic sheeting on your windows.&amp;nbsp;It will add more insulation and reduce icy drafts with minimal effort and cost.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Check the insulation in your doors.&amp;nbsp;Place your hand against it from the inside. If it feels cooler than the inside walls, install a door that&amp;#39;s better insulated.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install fully insulated doors on all entrances&amp;nbsp;to garages, cold storage rooms and un-insulated basements.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keep the garage door tightly closed as much as possible.&amp;nbsp;It will keep warmer air against the garage-side wall of the house and act as a buffer against the colder air outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Lighting tips&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install automatic timers, motion sensors, dimmers and solar cells.&amp;nbsp;They will help you conserve energy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Switch from traditional bulbs to energy efficient lighting.&amp;nbsp;Use up to 40% less energy both indoors and out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Switch off the lights when you leave a room.&amp;nbsp;It costs about $2.55 per year to light one room for one hour - easy money to save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

"1291","en","article","1","11","Energy efficiency tips for the spring","1516736496","1568671527","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;This has so many tips! Find out how to make sure that your home is ready for the warmer weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Make sure all your fans are dust-free and working properly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wash or replace filters regularly. Consider installing a timer switch on your bathroom fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Change the direction of airflow on your ceiling fan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In winter, let the fan push warm air down towards the floor. In spring, switch the direction and draw air upwards, cooling the room and ensuring constant airflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Clean your sliding glass door track&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dirty track can ruin the door&amp;#39;s seal and create gaps where heat or cold air can escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Check your refrigerator&amp;#39;s condenser coils&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the coils are free from dust and pet hair and that air can circulate freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Check the seals on your refrigerator door&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your refrigerator accounts for up to 11% of your household&amp;#39;s total energy use. Make sure the seals are clean and tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Inspect your foundation walls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an unfinished basement or crawlspace, check for air leaks by looking for spider webs. If there&amp;#39;s a web, there&amp;#39;s a draft. A large amount of heat is also lost from a non-insulated basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Invest in some insulated, thermal-backed drapes for your windows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll help keep your home cool in summer and warm in winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;8. Install an attic ventilator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the same level of comfort as an air conditioner at a much lower cost. Pump in cool air during summer evenings, then seal your home during the day. Attic ventilation can help lower winter heating bills too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;9. Choose an electric-powered lawn mower&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike gas-powered lawn mowers that emit greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change, electric-powered lawn mowers do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10. Buy the smallest capacity AC unit that will suit your needs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calculate the energy efficiency ratio (EER) by dividing the unit&amp;#39;s cooling capacity (BTU&amp;#39;s/hour) by its energy requirement (watts). An EER of 10 or more is very good, and 6 or 7 is fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making energy efficient home updates this summer can make a big difference on annual energy bills. &amp;nbsp;By performing five energy efficient upgrades around the house, such as sealing leaks and topping up insulation, we&amp;nbsp;calculated that Ontario homeowners could save more than $600 on their combined energy bills annually— a much-needed savings now that electricity during peak hours is double the rate of off-peak hours (as of May 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With warm weather upon us and the recent rise in electricity rates, now is the time for homeowners to make upgrades around the house and increase energy efficiency. &amp;nbsp;Implementing professional upgrades, as well as simple do-it-yourself techniques could help Ontarians conserve energy and reduce their gas and electricity bills, which is good for the environment and their wallets too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data from HOT2000 software (recognized by Natural Resources Canada as the Canadian tool for use by trained and certified energy auditors), we&amp;nbsp;calculated that homeowners who invest in the following upgrades will see a return of more than $600 per year on their combined energy (natural gas and electricity) bills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Caulking and weather-stripping around doors, windows and exterior wall electrical outlets to keep the moist hot air out in the summer, and warm air in during the winter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Installing high-efficiency windows. Up to 30 per cent of the heating and cooling costs in a home can be lost through poorly fitted windows and doors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Checking that there is at least&amp;nbsp;16 inches of insulation in the attic – anything less and homeowners will need to budget to get it topped up. A properly insulated home is one of the fastest and most cost effective ways to cut down on heating and cooling costs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replacing an HVAC system that’s older than 15 to 17 years with a high-efficiency air conditioner and furnace.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Upgrading a traditional hot water heater to a tankless or condensing water heater can save up to 40 percent in energy consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savings were calculated with pre-May 1 electricity rates and current natural gas prices using a typical Ontario home profile, which is defined by the Canadian Real Estate Association, Statistics Canada and Natural Resources Canada as 1,860 square feet, 40 years old and two stories. Depending on a home’s size, age and energy use patterns, some homeowners could see an even greater return on investment with these upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the wintry chill sets in&amp;nbsp;homeowners are turning up the thermostat for the first time since last winter.&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, this often results in higher energy bills. In order to cut down on energy use while keeping your home comfortable and safe this winter, it is important to make sure your home is running at peak efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the most effective tips for saving money on your energy bills this season:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Maintain your furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to clean or replace your furnace&amp;nbsp;filter&amp;nbsp;every three months. By regularly cleaning or replacing the filter, you can save as much as 10% off your energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clogged filters mean that furnace motors must work harder and use more energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Take advantage of free heat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open drapes during the day to let the sun’s rays warm your space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re entertaining over the holiday season consider lowering your thermostat by a few degrees. A house full of guests will generate extra body heat which helps you reduce energy use while still keeping your home comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/enercare-advantage/furnace-rental&quot;&gt;Rent a high-efficiency furnace for as little as $49.50/month - view special offer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Install&amp;nbsp;a programmable thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knocking the temperature down at night, and during the day when nobody is home, can save as much as 10% on heating bills. By doing this throughout the winter months you’ll see a noticeable different on your energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Seal those leaks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check for any air leaks or cracks around windows and doors. Up to 30 per cent of the heating and cooling costs in a home can be lost through poorly fitted windows and doors. Caulking and weather stripping around existing openings or installing new energy-efficient windows can save home owners about $150 a year on their energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Get more insulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving your home’s insulation is one of the fastest and most cost effective ways to cut down on heating costs. You should have approximately 12 inches of insulation in your attic, anything less and you should get it topped up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;6. Add a humidifier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dry, cold air combined with the furnace running can reduce the amount of moisture in the home during the winter. Adding a humidifier to your heating system is one of the best things a homeowner can do to maintain proper moisture levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest benefits of proper humidification in the home is a financial one. Using a humidifier allows you to turn the thermostat down one or two degrees while still maintaining a comfortable feeling, thus lowering your heating bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;7. Bonus tip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operate your oven more efficiently by using the oven light to inspect what you’re cooking or baking. Ovens lose approximately 20 per cent of their heat every time you open the door.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

"1306","en","article","1","11"," Shovel snow the right way","1516655487","1593730140","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let winter get the best of you; learn how to safely remove the white stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Canadians, we are all too familiar with having to shovel piles of snow after a major winter storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this might seem like a routine chore, there are simple techniques that you can use to help prevent a potential injury this season. Here are some valuable tips to consider before tackling the snow this winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Use the right type of shovel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose a lightweight shovel that&amp;rsquo;s right for you. If the shovel feels heavy before you have even started, the snow will only make the load heavier. It is also important that the hand grip is made of wood and not metal as metal can get cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the right shovel, it is important to keep your hands about 12 inches apart with one hand close to the blade and the other on the handle. This will provide you with better stability and more control over the shovel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Don&amp;#39;t let the snow pile up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for a large snowfall to begin shoveling. Try to clear the snow earlier and more often. Waiting for the snow to pile up can increase the risk of injury, as shoveling smaller piles more frequently is quicker and requires less energy than tackling a larger load after a heavy snowfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Use safe shoveling techniques&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are getting ready to shovel, it is crucial to bend at the hips and the knees, and not at the lower back. This will enable you to work with your legs while keeping your back straight, preventing a potential back injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important technique to remember is to push the snow in the desired direction as opposed to lifting it. Pushing allows you to control the pile without having to lift a heavy load. Remember, snow is heavier than it looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Take frequent breaks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A heavy snowfall creates an exhausting job for anyone responsible for clearing it. It is important to break frequently, stretch your body, and head inside regularly to warm up. Shoveling snow in the cold weather can place a huge amount of stress on your body, therefore it is important to pace yourself and not rush to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start shoveling slowly with smaller piles as a warm up and continue on with a steady pace.&amp;nbsp;It is most important to listen to your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you begin to feel sore or exhausted, take a break and come back to the task later.&lt;/p&gt;

Be sure to install a protective barrier and teach your kids not to touch the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A natural gas flame and small children are not an ideal combination, so if you have toddlers running around an unprotected fireplace, there are safety precautions that should be implemented in your home. To prevent incidents and keep your kids safe, you should put ground rules in place to minimize the risks of an accident involving your fireplace. The list below will give you a few examples of where to start and minimize stress because after all, your fireplace is there to be enjoyed! Here is what you should do to help keep your family protected:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Teach your kids about the dangers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing works better than education, and teaching your children from an early age about fire safety is very beneficial. Teaching them to stay away from the natural gas fireplace and not to touch the glass panel in front of the flames, should be an integral part of their education. There are a lot of helpful videos available online to help make the learning process fun and interactive. Although education is key, don&amp;rsquo;t forget that kids are curious by nature so it is still important to watch them while they are around the fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Never leave the fireplace running&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accidents typically happen when parents temporarily leave the room, leaving the kids without supervision for a few critical minutes. This can be easily prevented by turning off the fireplace before going away to do something else or taking your kids away from the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Install barriers to block access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing an obstacle between the fireplace and the rest of the room is a mandatory safety measure if you have kids under the age of five. Small children won&amp;rsquo;t be able to get around the obstacle and may be discouraged from trying in the future. Not only will the child be prevented from touching the hot glass, they won&amp;rsquo;t be able to tamper with the command buttons either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, we always recommend you consult an expert for complete safety assurance. All of these measures will help to ensure that your natural gas fireplace is both beneficial for your family and safe for your children.&lt;/p&gt;

"1316","en","article","1","46","What is green or renewable energy?","1516750757","1568673999","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;All that you need to know about renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green or renewable energy&amp;nbsp;comes from sources that occur naturally - leading to an infinite supply of this energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Solar power (heat from the sun)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hydro power (movement of water)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wind power (movement of wind)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Geothermal power (heat from friction inside the earth)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Biomass energy (from biological material)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-renewable energy sources&amp;nbsp;result from the extraction and burning of coal, oil and petroleum - otherwise called fossil fuels. Although they might also occur naturally inside the earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, there&amp;rsquo;s only a finite amount available. This leads to concerns over future energy shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, most of the world&amp;#39;s energy consumption&amp;nbsp;comes from non-renewable energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates&amp;nbsp;that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=527&amp;amp;t=4&quot;&gt;only 10% of the world&amp;#39;s energy comes from renewable energy sources&lt;/a&gt;. The EIA projects that number to increase to 14% by 2035.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green energy sources are gaining popularity as viable alternatives&amp;nbsp;such as bio-diesel to create fuel for vehicles, including ethanol. Electric and solar-powered cars are also gaining popularity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you learn what classifies energy as green or renewable, you will be able to use energy more effectively for the benefit of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Reduce the amount you drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Walk whenever possible - it&amp;#39;s good exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use public transportation if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make your trips as efficient as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Start a carpool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Be smart about your water&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Purchase a filter for your tap water instead of buying bottled water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Up to 47 million gallons of oil are used annually just to create plastic water bottles, according to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/about/live-healthy/tap-water-vs-bottled-water&quot;&gt;Food and Water Watch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;75% of these bottles are not recycled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Reduce waste at home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pay your bills online to reduce paper materials.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Re-use plastic shopping bags to line trash cans.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fertilize your garden with old fruits and vegetables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Eat organic or locally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Buy local foods, versus ones that have travelled hundreds of miles by truck.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reduce the carbon footprint that comes with shipping produce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Be smart about your energy use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off the lights when you leave a room.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off the television when you&amp;#39;re finished watching it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wash your clothes in cold water.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Replace your conventional light bulbs with energy efficient ENERGY STAR&amp;reg;&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing the type of HVAC system you will use in the home is a big deal. For many home owners, little information is known about such heating and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/cooling#blog&quot;&gt;cooling systems&lt;/a&gt;, making a choice difficult when it comes to a new installation. For the most part, one has to decide what type of unit to install based on a number of factors including energy efficiency and installation cost. Below is a short guide comparing two energy types to see what might work best for your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric heating and cooling is a type of HVAC system that is commonly used in the home. Unit types include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enercare.ca/blog/air-conditioning/how-ductless-ac-works-benefits-and-options&quot;&gt;ductless systems&lt;/a&gt;, central units and even window air conditioning systems. With an electric air conditioning installation, it is important to choose a unit that has a SEER rating that will support your needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term SEER stands for Seasonal Energy Efficient Ratio. This term refers to the amount of cooling output of the air conditioning unit over a typical cooling season. This ratio is divided by the energy it consumes in Watt-Hours. A unit with a higher SEER rating means that the air conditioning system will use less energy to provide quality cooling in your home. It is recommended that you have a unit that functions with a 14 SEER or higher to spend less on cooling your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural Gas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a gas installation, there is a little bit more involved than with an electric system. The unit will provide heating due to a gas burner with a fuel source of propane or natural gas. Because of this, additional components are needed during an installation such as piping and a connection to a gas line. An existing home can easily be converted to gas if the home owner so chooses. For new construction homes, a gas installation is easy if gas is installed to the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be confusing to make the decision between gas and electric units. To find out more, it is recommended that you consult with professional technicians in the heating and cooling industry. At Enercare, we will assist you by providing insight into both types of units. We will help you make an informed decision based on all factors that should be considered including energy efficiency and installation cost.

"1336","en","article","1","11","5 things every homeowner should do to prepare for cold weather","1516658883","1571418273","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Facing the challenges of a Canadian winter is difficult enough without adding a weather-related crisis at home to&amp;nbsp;the mix. Remember to follow these tips&amp;nbsp;to avoid any mishaps and stay two steps ahead of Mother Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying above-average temperatures so far this winter, it appears our luck has finally run out.&amp;nbsp;Forecasts&amp;nbsp;are calling for frigid weather, so here are a few&amp;nbsp;things you should consider to ensure your home is prepared for&amp;nbsp;the cold.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you forgot how to deal with Canadian winters, don’t fret. Follow these simple tips from Enercare Home&amp;nbsp;Services to keep your house warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Protect your pipes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants to deal with the mess (and expense) of frozen pipes. Get ahead of the game by taking some&amp;nbsp;precautions. For areas with poor insulation such as&amp;nbsp;your kitchen or bathroom sinks, keep the cabinets open to&amp;nbsp;allow extra heat to reach the pipes. If you want to go one step further, seal up any cracks in your insulation and&amp;nbsp;use foam pipe wrap to cover pipes that are particularly susceptible to the cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Pay attention to your furnace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a look at your furnace filter. Is it dirty? Toss it and replace with a new one. Doing this can reduce your&amp;nbsp;energy consumption and save you in heating costs.&amp;nbsp;Also inspect your furnace for any signs of leakage or&amp;nbsp;deterioration. If something seems concerning, call a home services company to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Stay safe with a winter emergency kit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never know when something might go wrong, so be prepared and make a winter emergency kit. Some items&amp;nbsp;you may want to include: a flashlight, battery-powered radio, portable cell phone charger, and bottled water. Keep&amp;nbsp;a good shovel and some rock salt handy for dealing with snow and ice on your walkway.&amp;nbsp;And don’t forget your&amp;nbsp;furry friends - bring any pets inside to keep them safe and warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4. Break out your cozy sweater&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to crank up your heat to stay warm, but a cheaper solution can be found right inside your wardrobe. Homeowners can save up to three percent on heating costs for every degree the thermostat is&amp;nbsp;lowered. So open the blinds, let the sunshine in and grab your favourite blanket. Your energy bill will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5. Winterize your ride&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As winter-proof and inviting as your home may be, you will likely have to venture outside at some point. If travel is&amp;nbsp;essential, make sure your vehicle has been&amp;nbsp;winterized. Check your washer fluid and antifreeze levels and ensure your battery is in good working order. Keep a shovel in the trunk in case you have&amp;nbsp;issues getting out of your&amp;nbsp;space. And don’t forget about what’s underneath the car; make sure you’re equipped with a good set of snow&amp;nbsp;tires to prevent slipping and skidding in icy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing the challenges of a Canadian winter is difficult enough without adding a weather-related crisis at home to&amp;nbsp;the mix. Remember to follow these tips&amp;nbsp;to avoid any mishaps and stay two steps ahead of Mother Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, winter can sometimes sneak up on you. It can come out of nowhere, and before you know it, you&amp;rsquo;ll be asking your heating system to be running at peak performance. So before the cold weather arrives, it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking some time in the fall to make a few simple home improvements that can help you to shave a few dollars off your monthly utility bill. With just a few&amp;nbsp;simple tips and tricks, you can help improve the overall performance and cost effectiveness of your furnace, and ensure your family stays warm all winter without breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Small cracks can be a big problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because you can&amp;rsquo;t see them, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they aren&amp;rsquo;t there. All that warm air generated by your furnace can easily find even the tiniest cracks and escape through them. Your walls most likely feature dozens of such weak spots, especially in places where brickwork meets a window opening or a similar break line. Locating and fixing these micro leaks is a great way to make your home warmer without running the furnace at maximum power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Control the humidity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality of breathable air inside your home is greatly dependent on proper humidity, so it&amp;rsquo;s probably a smart idea to buy a furnace humidifier for your home if you don&amp;rsquo;t already own one. This little device allows you to precisely monitor the amount of moisture in the air and keep the humidity at the desired level. Not only will it improve the quality of the air inside your house, it will also help reduce your energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Get a heat recovery ventilator (HRV)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installing an HRV device is another crucial improvement that should be executed before the cold season starts. These ventilators allow for proper influx of fresh air while keeping most of the heat inside, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a genius to figure why this is a win-win proposition. An HRV device will help keep your home well ventilated and free from dangerous gases, while your energy bill may decrease at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let the filters get dirty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever your furnace is turned on and in operation, a certain amount of dust particles will move through the system and wind up on the filters. If the filters aren&amp;rsquo;t changed regularly, this may develop into a serious issue and hamper normal distribution of hot air. It is a good idea to always have a spare filter or two ready to go so this step won&amp;rsquo;t be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the temperature drops and we find ourselves craving more time indoors, a fireplace brings warmth to your home and comforts your loved ones. For your wood-burning fireplace (rather than a natural gas fireplace) to work at its best, it needs to be cleaned and maintained on an ongoing basis. Neglecting it for too long can lead to issues including excessive smoke or even damage to your property. However, if appropriate care is applied, your wood-burning fireplace could be the centre of your home for many years, without putting you or your family at risk. We’ve put together our top recommended tips that could help keep your fireplace in working order and help ensure safety for all members in the home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ensure that all connections are secure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things to do is to check all the pipes that lead the heat/smoke away from the house and pay special attention to all connecting segments. One loose screw is enough to cause leakage and small problems can quickly turn into large issues. Once you locate any damaged spots or poorly fitted connectors, you should replace them before you start using your fireplace. Call a professional to do an assessment if any of the connections seem to be loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Touch the wall to see if it heats up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chimney is designed to serve as a safety valve that helps eliminate excessive heat, but if it’s blocked, it won’t be able to serve that function. The elevated temperature of the wall directly above the fireplace is one indicator that the chimney is not working properly. To check on your own, you can simply touch the wall with the palm of your hand to determine whether it’s unusually hot, but professional assistance is recommended to clear out the clogged chimney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Notice the corrosion early&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metal parts and pipes could be affected by corrosion even if you can’t see any rust on the surface. It’s good practice to do an annual inspection, looking for suspicious bulges or tiny dots of darker colour that could indicate damage. Any corroded parts should be replaced immediately to limit the damage as it could affect the normal operation of your fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Put a spark guard in front of your fireplace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood-burning fireplaces often emit sparks that can potentially cause issues to the surrounding areas if not well-maintained. A screen between the open flame and the rest of the room will help ensure that logs won’t be able to damage your floor or household items, allowing you to enjoy cozy nights by the fire, stress-free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The furnace efficiency rating helps establish how much energy will be needed to heat your home and, essentially, how much it will cost you. Typically, the higher your furnace efficiency rating the less energy your heating system requires to heat your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFUE Rating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFUE (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/products/energuide/label/reading/13666&quot;&gt;Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency&lt;/a&gt;) rating measures energy efficiency in furnaces. The higher the AFUE rating, the more efficient the unit is. The voluntary EnerGuide label displays the model type and AFUE rating. It also includes a pointer to show where that rating falls on a scale of energy efficiency in comparison to similar models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that AFUE ratings are a seasonal measure of fuel efficiency and do not include the electrical energy required to operate controls, fans or pumps. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENERGY STAR®&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ENERGY STAR® initiative is a partnership between the Government of Canada and industry to promote energy efficiency. Canadians can look for the ENERGY STAR symbol on products, new homes and industrial facilities to help guide purchase decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Humidifiers benefit your home and your health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Enercare humidifier&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;df152c1c-1ff2-48a0-86e7-aa4a6ad4fd27&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/img1807.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting ready for winter? At Enercare, we believe that maintaining proper indoor air quality is one of the best things you can do for your family’s comfort and well-being, especially during the cold winter months when we tend to spend a lot of time indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dry, cold air, combined with the furnace running non-stop can reduce the amount of moisture in your home, which can lead to health issues, higher levels of static and dry skin. Using a humidifier is one of the best things a homeowner can do to maintain proper moisture levels and to help improve your family’s health and the general comfort of your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some houses are equipped with humidifiers integrated into their overall HVAC systems, while in other instances, a portable unit can be extremely effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Below are some of the ways a humidifier can be good for your health and your home, according to Derek Brown, an Enercare product expert:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don’t get shocked this winter! When the air is dry, static electricity is often the cause of frizzy hair, static cling and the shocks that come when touching almost anything metallic around your home. Increasing your home’s humidity level will help reduce these issues.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A humidifier can help the body’s immune system guard against irritants, keeping your family healthy. Dry air can cause many illnesses and respiratory conditions. This includes dry nasal passages leading to nosebleeds and snoring, chapped and itchy skin, and symptoms of both asthma and allergies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Proper moisture levels can combat muscle and joint pain and a lack of concentration, all of which can result from dehydration.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dry air can also wreak havoc on your home itself. Maintaining proper humidity levels can prevent your hardwood floors, wood molding and furniture from shrinking and cracking, while also preventing the wallpaper from peeling.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One of the biggest benefits of proper humidification in the home is a financial one. Using a humidifier may allow you to turn the thermostat down one or two degrees while still maintaining a comfortable environment, potentially lowering your heating bills. Warm air holds more moisture than cold air, which means the home’s temperature can be lower, but still feel comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

"1366","en","article","1","16","Fall Cleaning Checklist","1507565230","1593730116","1","","en","","","","","","","","&lt;p&gt;Cleaning in the spring has always been a popular activity to prepare you home for everything that goes on over the next few months.&amp;nbsp; We believe that fall cleaning is an important activity that helps ensure a healthy family and clean home.&amp;nbsp; Read on to learn more about out fall cleaning checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all do some level of spring cleaning, but have you ever considered making fall cleaning an annual tradition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of items that can help you with a regular deep clean throughout the year, but autumn sometimes requires some special tools. Since fall typically arrives at the same time as cold and flu season, it’s important that it’s not just your floors and windows that are clean, but also the air your family is breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this fall cleaning check-list for some great tips from some of our Enercare experts:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Image inside a home's ductwork&quot; data-entity-type=&quot;file&quot; data-entity-uuid=&quot;aa9d7da6-2cce-4542-bf94-0cc09fddca0c&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/inline-images/duct_cleaning_image_a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duct cleaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the indoor air within your home enters through your duct work, which is incorporated into your HVAC system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since pollutants, mildew and bacteria can build up in your ducts, along with dust and dirt, it’s critical that you have your air ducts checked and&amp;nbsp;cleaned&amp;nbsp;routinely. Get your fall heating tune-up while you’re at it to make sure your heating system is running efficiently. Don’t forget to have your air filter replaced to ensure you’re breathing the healthiest air possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help your indoor air to be as healthy as possible, ensure you’re vacuuming on a regular basis, and not just your floors. Vacuum your furniture, drapes, baseboards, and everything else you can reach. Vacuuming helps decrease allergic reactions because you’re actually sucking up and removing those pesky allergens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indoor environmental health is so much more important in the fall and winter simply because we spend so much more time inside when the weather gets cold. Help keep your home’s indoor air healthy by dusting your mantles, windowsills, ceiling mounted light fixtures and even the top of your cabinets. Dusting not only helps keep your family breathing safe air, it also helps make sure all your stuff is clean and prepared when it’s eventually time to put up holiday decorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declutter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have done this in the spring, but now it’s time to get out those fall sweaters and donate anything that you don’t wear or no longer fits. Fall is a perfect time to clean out those closets because organizations are often taking donations for warmer clothing. Go through your coats, sweatshirts, winter hats, and even your winter boots and donate any gently used items to your nearest shelter.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Yard cleaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t neglect the outdoors! You’ve spent all summer enjoying your backyard but now it’s time to unclog the gutters, rinse off the patio furniture, gather the leaves, and do one final mow. Also, clear out your hoses and store them properly to ensure there is no leftover water that could freeze during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
