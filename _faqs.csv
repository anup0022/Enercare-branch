"en","faq_question","1","16","How does an air conditioner work?","1568662203","1574447755","1","","en","","","","","","","","Most central air conditioning systems are made up of two parts or what is called a split system. The outdoor unit contains a condenser coil, compressor, fan and electrical components. The indoor portion sits on top of the natural gas or propane furnace and is called the evaporator coil or “A” coil. The purpose of an air conditioner is to remove the heat and humidity from the home’s air to make it cooler.


	A central air conditioning system will start up when the attached thermostat senses that the temperature has increased above a preset level.
	The liquid refrigerant inside the evaporator coil converts to gas and as the warm humid indoor air passes over it, it absorbs the heat and removes the humidity which cools the air.
	The furnace’s blower fan then circulates the chilled air up through the home’s ductwork and out into the various living areas.
	Meanwhile, the refrigerant gas travels outside the house through a copper pipe (line set) to the compressor. The compressor pressurizes the gas and moves the refrigerant through the condenser coil. As the condenser fan pulls cool air through the condenser coil it changes the refrigerant back to liquid form thus continuing the refrigeration cycle.
	The humidity that was pulled from the air turns into condensation which is removed from the evaporator coil via the condensate drain line.
	The heated air in the home circulates through the cold air returns and back into the system to be cooled down and dehumidified again.

The air conditioner works with the furnace fan to transfer cool air throughout the home. We recommend that you change or clean your furnace filter every one-to-three months.

"en","faq_question","1","16","What size air conditioner do I need?","1568662708","1623944542","1","","en","","","","","","","","Every home is unique and a number of factors impact the air conditioner size needed, including the size and age of your home, air flow, how many windows you have, insulation, and specific homeowner requirements. To make sure you get the air conditioner size that best suits your needs, it’s critical to have a professional visit your home to complete an evaluation to calculate heat gain and air flow. Incorrect sizing of an air conditioner may cause a shortened life of the equipment, higher utility costs and diminished comfort because the home isn’t cooling down or dehumidifying correctly.

"en","faq_question","1","16","What is the lifespan of an air conditioner?","1568662760","1568662798","1","","en","","","","","","","","Your air conditioner’s age is a key indicator when deciding on an AC replacement. The average lifecycle of equipment is 15 years. But age is not the only factor to consider. Other reasons you may need to replace your air conditioner include safety, frequency of breakdowns, installation quality, and improper sizing.","126","What is the lifespan of an air conditioner?"
"en","faq_question","1","16","What does an air conditioner cost?","1568662809","1623944476","1","","en","","","","","","","","The average price range of a typical new high-efficiency central air conditioner in Ontario ranges from $3,500 to $6,000. This price includes standard installation from a fully-insured, licensed company, at least a one year warranty and all required licenses for installation.

The cost of an air conditioner is dependent on four factors:


	Environmental choices, including energy efficiency, sound output, air filtration sizes (which depend on allergies or other sensitivities), and comfort-enhancing options.
	Personal choices including extended warranties, maintenance plans and guarantees.
	Technical requirements, including the size of your home, floor plan, number of stories, existing ductwork and BTU load.
	Code requirements including safety, licensing and building code requirements.

	A natural gas or propane high-efficiency furnace will start up when an attached thermostat senses that the temperature has dropped below a preset level.
	Before the furnace starts, the ventor motor does a safety check to ensure that the venting is clear, as determined by the pressure switch. The ignitor then ignites the burners inside the furnace combustion chamber and starts creating heat. The heat is transferred to the primary or &quot;first&quot; heat exchanger which heats the air as it flows through the furnace. Afterwards, the combustion gases are passed through a secondary heat exchanger to further extract heat.
	The blower motor pushes the warmed air through the plenum and out into the house via the registers.
	The combustion gases, including carbon monoxide, are safely vented to the outdoors from the furnace.
	In most cases, outside fresh air is pulled into the burn chamber to provide a more efficient burn. However, this practice isn’t done in old homes.
	Any cold air left in the home gets circulated into the furnace to be heated up.

Hard water minerals primarily consist of positively charged calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+) metal ions, and sometimes other dissolved compounds such as bicarbonates and sulfates.

"en","faq_question","1","16","How does hard water affect your home/water heater?","1568752511","1568752543","1","","en","","","","","","","","In many places across Ontario, ground water comes into contact with sufficient concentrations of calcium and magnesium. The harder the water, the more problems homeowners will encounter in terms of scale buildup in their pipes, regular and tankless water heaters, and dishwashers. Scale buildup can make water heater and dishwasher units less energy efficient while shortening the life of equipment and clogging your faucets and taps. Hard water can also cause water spotting while lessening the effectiveness of soap and detergent. Producing soft water from hard water involves a process called ion exchange.

"en","faq_question","1","16","How can I best maintain my water heater?","1568752551","1568752569","1","","en","","","","","","","","Install a water softener into your home. The resin or mineral inside the brine tank is specially designed to remove the “hard” particles of lime and calcium, by a simple ion exchange process. This will help to prevent sediment and scale build up in your water heater keeping it in the best shape possible.

"en","faq_question","1","16","How does a water softener work?","1568752576","1568752595","1","","en","","","","","","","","A concentrated solution of sodium/salt (brine tank) is flushed through beads, also called resin. The resin beads inside the softener tank have a different or opposite electrical charge than the dissolved particles of the incoming water. Because of this electrical charge difference, the dissolved particles suspended in your water will cling to the resin beads on contact, thereby ridding the water of these particles, causing the water exiting the unit to be “soft”. The resin has a limit on the amount of hardness particles it can hold, which is why there are many different sizes of softeners and also why regeneration or brining is required.

Note: if the date is a series of numbers and letters, you may have to visit the manufacturers' website guide.

Although the average useful life expectancy of a water heater is approximately 16 years, some tanks can last longer and others can last less. Below are some warning signs to look out for:


	Rusty water coming from the water heater/piping

	Are installed mostly in homes built previous to 2000 (and usually have a built in chimney) making them one of the more commonly used water heaters in Ontario.
	Keep a reservoir of hot water available at all times so that when you turn on the tap, it's ready to use.
	Require an exit drain near the base of tank (usually in basement).
	Are good for high volume hot water applications.
	Can be fueled by either natural gas or propane gas.


Power Vents (PV) Starting from $26.49/month:


	Are installed mostly in homes built after 1995, homes with no chimney or homes that have converted from another water heating source making them one of the more commonly used water heaters in Ontario.
	Blower motor is attached to the tank and pushes exhaust gas outside the home via the side wall.
	Usually provide long venting lengths.
	Can be fueled by either natural gas or propane gas.


Direct Vents (DV) Starting from $29.64/month:


	Are used where there is insufficient combustible air/where air is unsuitable for combustion (ie. bedroom or bathroom installations).


Power Direct Vents (PDV) Starting from $32.93/month:


	Are similar to DV but instead use a two-pipe system for venting.


Electric Water Heaters Starting from $13.49/month:


	Use heating coils instead of natural gas to provide hot water for home.


Tankless Water Heaters Starting from $40.99/month:


	Do not contain storage tanks and fit compactly on a wall mount.
	Heat up on demand and deliver an endless supply of hot water by regulating water flow.
	Use less energy than conventional units, making them more efficient and environmentally friendly.


Condensing Water Heaters Starting from $43.75/month:


	Are similar to conventional units in that they both burn gas, exhaust flues and store hot water in an insulated tank.
	Exhaust gas and condensate exits through outlet at bottom of tank.
	Use less energy than conventional units because of how heat is transferred to water making them more efficient and environmentally friendly.

","1570206738","1570208994","1","","en","","","","","","","","Regeneration occurs when a concentrated solution of sodium/salt (brine tank) is flushed through the beads and “scrubs” them, removing the calcium/magnesium ions and flushing them out of the system. The brine tank is also flushed of any excess salt and then refills itself. When the system is regenerating, soft water cannot be produced, so the process may be scheduled during off-peak times (e.g. between 2 am to 4 am) as determined by the homeowner.

	On a fixed schedule (e.g. every 5 days). This method is based on old technology which uses more salt and consumes more electricity.
	Based on the amount of water processed by the water softener. This method triggers a regeneration cycle based on consumption when the resin cannot bond with the calcium/magnesium anymore because it is saturated. Enercare’s water softeners use this method.

That residue is left behind everywhere the water makes contact (e.g. your hair, your skin, your tub, etc.). With softened water, soap rinses off completely. So what felt “normal” with hard water was actually caused by the friction you felt between your skin and the soapy residue. Your hair, for example, squeaked when you rubbed it when toweling. Remove that residue/friction and it will feel silky because there is no residue left behind. With softened water, you will use less soap/detergent, your hair will have more shine and bounce, your towels will be fluffier and the pores of your skin will not be as clogged with soap.

	Valve is not regenerating due to a mechanical problem
	Salt may be bridged (become solid) above water that is at the bottom of the brine tank
	The valve could be failing to draw the brine solution out and if you have a float shut off in the brine tank, it would be preventing the brine tank from overflowing (which it would do if the float was not shut off)
	The brine refill control could be clogged, preventing water from refilling the brine tank

1. A natural gas or propane high-efficiency boiler will start up when an attached thermostat senses that the temperature has dropped below a preset level.

2. The ignitor ignites and starts heating up the heat exchanger which is a web of copper piping that transfers its heat to water.

3. The heated water is pumped (using an electrically powered pump) throughout the home via radiators or radiant floor systems where the heat radiates to warm the air in the room.

4. As the water travels throughout the home it will start to condense (cools) and when it has gone through all the radiators it travels back to the boiler to be heated up again until the house reaches the temperature set on the thermostat.

A boiler’s efficiency rating is dependent on how much fuel is wasted and how much fuel is used to produce a specific amount of heat. This is measured by something called the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency Rating (A.F.U.E.). Boilers with an A.F.U.E. rating of 85% or higher are considered to be high efficiency. Boilers with an ENERGY STAR® label are tested to meet strict efficiency specifications and are certified by an independent third party.
